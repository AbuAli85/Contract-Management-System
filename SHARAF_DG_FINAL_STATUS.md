  "promoter": {

    "id_card_url": "https://...",
    "passport_url": "https://..."
  },

    "name_ar": "شرف DG"
  },
  "employer": {
    "name_en": "Your Company",
    "name_ar": "شركتك"

3. Upload to Google Drive
4. Return PDF URL
5. (Optional) Update contract.terms with PDF URL

---

## 🔄 **PDF Workflow:**

### **Current Approach (No pdf_status column):**

```
1. Create Contract ✅
   ↓
2. Click "Generate PDF" ✅
   ↓
3. Webhook sends data to Make.com ✅
   ↓
4. Make.com processes (~30-40 seconds)
   ↓
5. After 2 minutes: "PDF Processing Complete"
   ↓
6. Check Make.com execution history for PDF
```

**Note:** Since `pdf_status` column doesn't exist, you'll need to check Make.com directly for the generated PDF.

---

## 💡 **Alternative: Add PDF Columns (Optional)**

If you want automatic PDF tracking, run this migration in Supabase:

```sql
-- Add PDF tracking columns
ALTER TABLE contracts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pdf_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS google_drive_url TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pdf_generated_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contracts_pdf_url 
ON contracts(pdf_url) 
WHERE pdf_url IS NOT NULL;
```

Then the form will automatically show download links!
