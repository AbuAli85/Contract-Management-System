# Logout Route Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was returning a 404 error when trying to access `portal.thesmartpro.io/en/auth/logout` because the route `/auth/logout` didn't exist.

## Root Cause
The application had:
- ✅ `/logout` route (correct logout page)
- ✅ `/api/auth/logout` route (API endpoint)
- ❌ `/auth/logout` route (missing - causing 404)

But some components were linking to `/auth/logout` instead of `/logout`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing Route
- **File**: `app/[locale]/auth/logout/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Redirects `/auth/logout` to the correct `/logout` route
- **Functionality**: 
  - Shows loading screen
  - Automatically redirects to `/{locale}/logout`
  - Handles locale detection

### 2. Fixed Component Links
- **File**: `components/sidebar.tsx`
  - Changed `<Link href={`/${locale}/auth/logout`}>` to `<Link href={`/${locale}/logout`}>`

- **File**: `components/app-layout-with-sidebar.tsx`
  - Changed `<a href={`/${locale}/auth/logout`}>` to `<a href={`/${locale}/logout`}>`

## Route Structure After Fix

```
✅ /logout                    - Main logout page (user-facing)
✅ /auth/logout              - Redirect to /logout (newly created)
✅ /api/auth/logout          - API endpoint for logout
```

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Direct Access**: Navigate to `/en/auth/logout` → Should redirect to `/en/logout`
2. **Sidebar Logout**: Click logout in sidebar → Should go to `/en/logout`
3. **Header Logout**: Click logout in header → Should go to `/en/logout`
4. **API Logout**: POST to `/api/auth/logout` → Should work as before

### Expected Behavior
- No more 404 errors
- Smooth redirect from `/auth/logout` to `/logout`
- Proper logout functionality maintained
- Locale support preserved

## Files Modified
1. `app/[locale]/auth/logout/page.tsx` - Created new redirect route
2. `components/sidebar.tsx` - Fixed logout link
3. `components/app-layout-with-sidebar.tsx` - Fixed logout link

## Notes
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing logout functionality is preserved
- Locale support is maintained
- No breaking changes to existing routes
