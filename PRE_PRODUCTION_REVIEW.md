## 🔍 Issues Found & Recommendations

### All Three Pages

#### ✅ Already Good
1. Error handling with retry logic
2. Loading states with skeletons
3. Permission checks
4. AbortController for request cancellation
5. React Query for caching
6. Responsive design

#### 💡 Recommended Improvements

**1. Empty State Messaging**

Since you're starting fresh, improve empty states:

```tsx
// Add helpful messages for empty state
{contracts.length === 0 && !loading && (
  <EmptyState
    icon={FileText}
    title="No contracts yet"
    description="Start by creating your first contract. You have 16 parties and 114 promoters ready to go!"
    action={{
      label: "Create First Contract",
      href: "/en/generate-contract"
    }}
  />
)}
```

**2. Contract Status Flow**

Ensure status transitions work properly:
- draft → pending (when submitted for review)
- pending → approved (when approved)
- pending → rejected (when rejected)
- approved → active (when started)

**3. Party Name Display**

The pages check for both `first_party` and `second_party`. With your clean schema:
- employer_id → Second Party (employer)
- client_id → First Party (client)

**4. Promoter Display**

Pages check for both `promoter` and `promoters`. Ensure consistency.
