## 📋 Pre-Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup (REQUIRED)

Run the following SQL to add user scoping:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor or via psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/add-created-by-column.sql
```

This will:
- Add `created_by` column to `promoters` table
- Create indexes for performance
- Set up RLS policies for user scoping
- Enable non-admins to only see their promoters

### Step 2: Uncomment User Scoping

In `app/api/promoters/route.ts`, uncomment line 246:

```typescript
// FROM:
// query = query.eq('created_by', user.id);

// TO:
query = query.eq('created_by', user.id);
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Verify these are set in production:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-production-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key

# RBAC Configuration (CRITICAL)
RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=enforce  # MUST be 'enforce' in production
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional but recommended
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-redis-url  # For distributed rate limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token
```

### Step 4: Assign User Roles

Run this SQL to set up admin users:

```sql
-- Get your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- Assign admin role
INSERT INTO user_role_assignments (user_id, role_id)
SELECT 'YOUR_USER_ID', id FROM roles WHERE name = 'admin'
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- OR update users table directly if role column exists
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- Verify
SELECT u.email, u.role FROM users u WHERE u.email = 'your@email.com';
```

### Step 5: Enable RLS Policies

Ensure RLS is enabled on the promoters table:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE promoters ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'promoters';
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: RBAC Protection
```bash
# Should return 403 Forbidden without auth token
curl https://your-domain.com/api/promoters

# Should return 401 Unauthorized with invalid token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" https://your-domain.com/api/promoters
```

### Test 2: Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make 11 requests rapidly (limit is 10/min)
for i in {1..11}; do
  curl https://your-domain.com/api/promoters \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
done
# 11th request should return 429 Too Many Requests
```

### Test 3: User Scoping
```bash
# Log in as non-admin user
# Should only see promoters created by that user

# Log in as admin user
# Should see all promoters
```

### Test 4: Bulk Actions
```bash
# Archive promoters
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/promoters/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "action": "archive",
    "promoterIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2"]
  }'
# Should return 200 OK with success message
```

## 🔍 Verification Queries

Run these after deployment to verify security:

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'promoters';

-- Check RLS policies exist
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'promoters';

-- Check created_by column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'promoters' AND column_name = 'created_by';

-- Check user roles are assigned
SELECT u.email, u.role
FROM users u
WHERE u.role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'user');

-- Check audit logs are working
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE table_name = 'promoters'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

---

## ⚠️ Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Option 1: Set RBAC to dry-run mode temporarily
export RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=dry-run

# Option 2: Disable RLS temporarily (NOT recommended)
ALTER TABLE promoters DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

# Option 3: Roll back to previous deployment
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Safe Rollback

```sql
-- Remove user scoping temporarily
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own promoters" ON promoters;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create promoters" ON promoters;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own promoters" ON promoters;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own promoters" ON promoters;

-- Keep RLS enabled but allow all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all promoters"
  ON promoters FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
```

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Rate Limit Violations**
   - Track 429 responses
   - Alert if > 100/hour

2. **RBAC Denials**
   - Track 403 responses
   - Review audit logs for unauthorized access attempts

3. **API Performance**
   - Monitor response times
   - Track query performance with user scoping

4. **Bulk Action Success Rate**
   - Monitor success/failure rates
   - Alert on unusual patterns

### Logging

Enable structured logging for security events:

```typescript
// In your monitoring tool
{
  event: 'rbac_denial',
  user_id: userId,
  required_permission: 'promoter:read:own',
  endpoint: '/api/promoters',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}
```

2. **Rate Limiting** - Protection against API abuse
3. **Real Bulk Actions** - Fully functional API endpoint
4. **Audit Logging** - Track all modifications
5. **Reusable Utilities** - Hooks and helpers for maintainability

### Breaking Changes

- **None!** All enhancements are additive
- Existing functionality preserved
- UI continues to work as before

### Performance Impact

- **Positive**: React Query caching reduces API calls
- **Minimal**: User scoping adds <10ms to queries
- **Positive**: Rate limiting prevents abuse
