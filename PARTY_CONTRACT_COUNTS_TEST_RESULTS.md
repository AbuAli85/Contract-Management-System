### Status Breakdown
- ✅ **Active**: 90 (79%)
- ⚠️ **Inactive/Office**: 5 (4%)
- ❌ **Terminated/Cancelled**: 5 (4%)
- ❓ **Unknown/Available**: 13 (11%)
- 🔧 **Other (V/IT)**: 2 (2%)

## 🔍 Data Quality Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing Employer Assignment**: 1 promoter (Ramy Elsaied Saber Elsharkawy)
2. **Unclear Status Values**: 13 promoters with "?", "V", or non-standard status
3. **Missing Passport Numbers**: ~20 promoters

### Warning Issues
1. **ID Cards Expiring Soon**: Multiple promoters with expiry in 2025
2. **Missing Arabic Name**: 1 promoter (hamayoun ahmad)
3. **Passport Expiring Soon**: Several promoters with 2025-2026 expiry

### Document Expiration Alert
Promoters with documents expiring in next 6 months:
- ID cards expiring before 2026-01-01: Multiple records
- Passports expiring before 2026-06-01: Several records

## 🧪 Testing the Contract Counts Fix

### Method 1: Via Web Interface
1. Navigate to: `/manage-parties` or `/en/manage-parties`
2. Check the "Contracts" column for each party
3. Verify the counts are no longer "0"
4. Click on a party to see their actual contracts

### Method 2: Via SQL Query
Run the test SQL file:
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql -d your_database < test-party-contract-counts.sql
```

### Expected Results
After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ Parties with contracts show accurate counts (not 0)
- ✅ Counts match across all foreign key columns (employer_id, client_id, first_party_id, second_party_id)
- ✅ "Total Contracts" statistics card shows 219 (or current total)
- ✅ Active contracts are counted separately from total contracts

### What Was Fixed
1. **Before**: All parties showed "0 contracts" (hardcoded)
2. **After**: Parties API queries contracts table and calculates real counts
3. **Foreign Keys Checked**: employer_id, client_id, first_party_id, second_party_id
4. **Deduplication**: Same contract appearing in multiple roles counted only once per party

## 📈 Promoter-Party Relationship Insights

### Employer Coverage
- **11 parties** have promoters assigned
- **Average**: ~10.4 promoters per employer
- **Top employer**: 20 promoters
- **Smallest employer**: 1 promoter

### Active Workforce Ratio
Based on active promoters:
- **79% active rate** (90 out of 114)
- This indicates healthy workforce utilization

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Assign employer** to Ramy Elsaied (ID: e46c7b6f-65ed-40e2-90f0-40697d3e856d)
2. **Clarify status** for 13 promoters with "?" status
3. **Update document expiry** notifications for promoters with expiring docs

#### Data Cleanup
1. Standardize status values (active, inactive, terminated, available)
2. Add missing passport numbers where possible
3. Fill in missing Arabic names
4. Review and update expiring documents

#### Monitoring
1. Set up alerts for document expiration (30-60 days before)
2. Regular audits for promoters without employers
3. Track active vs inactive ratio trends

## 🎯 Contract Counting Logic

The fix implements the following logic:

```typescript
// Query all contracts
const contractData = await supabase
  .from('contracts')
  .select('employer_id, client_id, first_party_id, second_party_id, status');

// For each party, count unique contract involvements
contractData.forEach((contract) => {
  const partyRoles = [
    contract.employer_id,
    contract.client_id,
    contract.first_party_id,
    contract.second_party_id,
  ].filter(id => id && partyIds.includes(id));
  
  // Count unique parties (handles party in multiple roles)
  const uniqueParties = [...new Set(partyRoles)];
  
  uniqueParties.forEach(partyId => {
    contractCounts[partyId].total += 1;
    if (['active', 'pending', 'approved'].includes(contract.status)) {
      contractCounts[partyId].active += 1;
    }
  });
});
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to Manage Parties page
- [ ] Verify all parties show non-zero contract counts
- [ ] Check that total matches expected 219 contracts
- [ ] Click on a party to see their contracts list
- [ ] Verify active vs total contract differentiation
- [ ] Check statistics cards update correctly
- [ ] Test pagination works with contract counts
- [ ] Verify counts in both table and grid views

## 📝 Notes

- Contract counts are calculated in real-time from the database
- Counts handle parties appearing in multiple roles correctly
- Active contracts filtered by status: active, pending, approved
- API response includes both `total_contracts` and `active_contracts`
- Page displays `total_contracts` in the main count column
