# 🔐 Resend Domain Verification - Fix Email Restrictions

## ⚠️ **Current Issue**

When using `onboarding@resend.dev` (test email), you can **only** send to:
- ✅ `chairman@falconeyegroup.net` (your verified account)
- ❌ NOT to `Operations@falconeyegroup.net` or other emails

**Error:**
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address
```

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Verify Your Domain** (15 minutes)

This will let you send to ANY email address using `@falconeyegroup.net`

### **Step 1: Add Domain to Resend** (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://resend.com/domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter: `falconeyegroup.net`
4. Click **"Add Domain"**

### **Step 2: Add DNS Records** (5 minutes)

Resend will show you 3 DNS records to add. You need to add these to your domain provider:

#### **Record 1: SPF (TXT)**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or falconeyegroup.net)
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
```

#### **Record 2: DKIM (TXT)**
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Resend will provide this - copy from dashboard]
```

#### **Record 3: DMARC (TXT)** - Optional but recommended
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@falconeyegroup.net
```

### **Step 3: Wait for Verification** (2-10 minutes)

- Resend will automatically check DNS records
- Usually takes 2-10 minutes
- Status will change from "Pending" to "Verified" ✅

### **Step 4: Update Your Environment** (1 minute)

Once verified, update `.env.local`:

```env
# Change from test email to your domain
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@falconeyegroup.net
# Or use any address:
# RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contracts@falconeyegroup.net
# RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@falconeyegroup.net
```

Then **restart your server** or **redeploy to production**.

## 🚀 **QUICK FIX (For Testing Right Now)**

If you want to test immediately without domain verification:

**Option 1: Send to Your Verified Email Only**

The notification is already sent to the promoter's database email. If that email is NOT `chairman@falconeyegroup.net`, you have two options:

**Option 2: Override for Testing** (temporary fix)

Add this to the notify API temporarily:

```typescript
// In app/api/promoters/[id]/notify/route.ts
// Around line 100-120

// TEMPORARY: For testing with onboarding@resend.dev
const emailRecipient = process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL === 'onboarding@resend.dev' 
  ? 'chairman@falconeyegroup.net'  // Send to verified email during testing
  : promoter.email || 'chairman@falconeyegroup.net';

await sendEmail({
  to: emailRecipient,
  // ... rest of email
});
```

## 🎯 **DOMAIN VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Go to resend.com/domains
- [ ] Add `falconeyegroup.net`
- [ ] Copy DNS records
- [ ] Add records to your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
- [ ] Wait for verification (2-10 minutes)
- [ ] Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` in environment
- [ ] Restart server or redeploy
- [ ] Test sending to any email! ✅

---

## 🔍 **Find Your DNS Provider**

Your domain `falconeyegroup.net` is registered with a provider. Common ones:
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap  
- Google Domains
- Cloudflare
- Route53 (AWS)

Log in to your provider → DNS Management → Add the 3 records from Resend

---

## 💡 **WHY This Happens**

Resend's free tier restrictions:
- `onboarding@resend.dev` = Test email (can only send to account owner)
- `yourname@yourdomain.com` = Verified domain (can send to anyone)

This prevents spam and abuse while testing.
