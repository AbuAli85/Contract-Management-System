fix: Resolve contract counting issue showing 0 for all parties

PROBLEM:
- Manage Parties page displayed 0 contracts for all 18 parties
- 219 contracts exist in database but weren't being counted
- Root cause: API returned hardcoded zeros instead of querying database

SOLUTION:
1. Updated /api/parties API to calculate actual contract counts
   - Queries contracts table for all foreign key relationships
   - Checks employer_id, client_id, first_party_id, second_party_id
   - Counts unique party involvements (handles dual roles)
   - Distinguishes total vs active contracts

2. Updated Manage Parties page to use API contract counts
   - Modified enhanceParty function to use total_contracts field
   - Updated TypeScript interfaces to support new fields

3. Updated Party type definition to include contract count fields
   - Added total_contracts and active_contracts to global Party interface

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Handles NULL foreign key values gracefully
- Parties can appear in multiple roles (employer/client)
- Active contracts = status in ['active', 'pending', 'approved']
- Added performance tracking (~100-200ms query time)

FILES MODIFIED:
- app/api/parties/route.ts
- app/[locale]/manage-parties/page.tsx
- lib/types.ts

TESTING:
✅ Build successful (npm run build)
✅ No linter errors
✅ TypeScript compilation clean

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Manage Parties now shows accurate contract counts
- Example: "Amjad Al Maerifa LLC: 73 contracts"
- Total contracts across parties matches database
