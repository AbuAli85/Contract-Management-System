# 🔍 Run Diagnostics Now - Quick Guide

**Time Required:** 5 minutes

---

## Step 1: Run the Diagnostic Script (2 minutes)

### Via Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Open https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Create new query
5. Copy everything from `scripts/diagnose-user-system.sql`
6. Click **RUN**
7. Wait for results

### Via CLI

```bash
supabase db execute --file scripts/diagnose-user-system.sql > results.txt
cat results.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Check These 6 Key Things (3 minutes)

### ✅ Checklist

#### 1. **Which tables exist?**

Look for section: `=== EXISTING TABLES ===`

- [ ] ✅ `profiles` exists
- [ ] ❌ `users` exists (problem if yes)
- [ ] Check: How many RBAC tables? (should be 4: roles, permissions, role_permissions, user_role_assignments)

**If you have BOTH `profiles` AND `users`:** ⚠️ You need consolidation migration

#### 2. **Foreign key structure**

Look for section: `=== FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS ===`

- [ ] Check: Do FKs point to `profiles.id` or `profiles.user_id`?
- [ ] ✅ Should all point to `profiles.id`
- [ ] ❌ If mixed, you need fixes

**If FKs are inconsistent:** ⚠️ You need consolidation migration

#### 3. **Data synchronization**

Look for section: `=== SAMPLE AUTH.USERS vs PROFILES ===`

Count how many show:
- ✅ OK: _____ 
- ❌ Email mismatch: _____
- ⚠️ Name mismatch: _____
- ⚠️ Role mismatch: _____

**If more than 10% mismatches:** ⚠️ You need consolidation migration

#### 4. **Orphaned records**

Look for section: `=== ORPHANED RECORDS CHECK ===`

- Profiles without auth.users: _____ (should be 0)
- auth.users without profiles: _____ (should be 0)

**If any orphans exist:** ⚠️ You need consolidation migration

#### 5. **RLS policy coverage**

Look for section: `=== RLS POLICIES ===`

Count policies:
- `profiles`: _____ (should be 5+)
- `user_role_assignments`: _____ (should be 3+)
- `roles`: _____ (should be 2+)

**If missing policies:** ⚠️ You need consolidation migration

#### 6. **Functions needing fixes**

Look for section: `=== SECURITY DEFINER FUNCTIONS ===`

Count functions with `⚠️ SECURITY DEFINER`: _____

**If count is 26:** ⚠️ You need function fixes migration

---

## Step 3: Determine What You Need (10 seconds)

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have ANY of these issues?
├─ Both profiles AND users tables → YES: Apply consolidation migration
├─ Data sync mismatches → YES: Apply consolidation migration
├─ Orphaned records → YES: Apply consolidation migration
├─ Multiple RBAC systems → YES: Apply consolidation migration
├─ Missing RLS policies → YES: Apply consolidation migration
└─ 26 SECURITY DEFINER functions → YES: Apply function fixes migration
```

### Quick Answer

**Most Common Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Migrations Needed |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Clean system, just function warnings** | Just `20251026_fix_function_search_paths.sql` |
| **Messy system with conflicts** | BOTH migrations |
| **Already consolidated, just warnings** | Just `20251026_fix_function_search_paths.sql` |

## Step 4: Record Your Results

### Fill This Out:

```
Date: _____________
Database: _____________

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS:

1. Tables Found:
   □ profiles (_____ columns)
   □ users (_____ columns) - should NOT exist
   □ roles (_____ columns)
   □ Other RBAC: ________________

2. Data Sync Issues:
   - Mismatches: _____ %
   - Orphaned profiles: _____
   - Missing profiles: _____

3. Foreign Keys:
   □ All consistent
   □ Mixed (needs fixing)

4. RLS Policies:
   - profiles: _____ policies
   - user_role_assignments: _____ policies
   
5. Security Warnings:
   - SECURITY DEFINER functions: _____

DECISION:
□ Apply consolidation migration
□ Apply function fixes migration
□ Apply BOTH
□ System is clean (no action needed)

NEXT STEP: ___________________

## Step 5: What To Do Next

### If you need consolidation migration:

```bash
# Next: Open USER_SYSTEM_FIX_GUIDE.md
# Go to: Step 3 - Apply Migrations
# Run: 20251026_consolidate_user_profile_system.sql
```

### If you need function fixes only:

```bash
# Next: Apply migration
supabase db push
# Or manually apply 20251026_fix_function_search_paths.sql
```

### If you need BOTH (most common):

```bash
# Next: Open USER_SYSTEM_FIX_GUIDE.md
# Follow: Complete Step 3
# Both migrations will apply in correct order
```

## 📊 Example Results Analysis

### Example 1: Clean System

```
EXISTING TABLES:
- profiles (15 columns) ✅
- roles (7 columns) ✅
- permissions (6 columns) ✅
- user_role_assignments (10 columns) ✅

ORPHANED RECORDS:
- Profiles without auth.users: 0 ✅
- auth.users without profiles: 0 ✅

DATA SYNC:
- All showing ✅ OK

- 26 functions ⚠️

VERDICT: Apply function fixes migration only
```

### Example 2: Messy System (Common)

```
EXISTING TABLES:
- profiles (10 columns)
- users (14 columns) ❌ Problem!
- rbac_roles (5 columns) ❌
- roles (7 columns) ❌ Conflict!

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After running diagnostics, you should be able to answer:

- [ ] I know which tables exist
- [ ] I know if I have orphaned data
- [ ] I know my data sync status
- [ ] I know which migrations I need
- [ ] I'm ready to proceed

**If all checked:** Proceed to apply migrations!
