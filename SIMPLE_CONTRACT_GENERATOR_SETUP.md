# 🚀 Simple Contract Generator - Setup Guide

## 📋 What I Fixed

You were right! The existing contract generation system was too complex and the backend wasn't handling the data properly. I've created a **Simple Contract Generator** that actually works.

## ✅ **What's New**

### **1. Simple Contract Generator** (`/simple-contract`)

- **Clean, easy-to-use interface** with only essential fields
- **Working backend API** that properly handles data

### **2. Fixed Backend Issues**

- **New API route**: `/api/contracts/simple-generate` that actually works
- **Proper data validation** and error handling
- **Correct database insertion** with all required fields
- **Make.com webhook integration** with complete data payload

### **3. Simplified Workflow**

1. **Select Promoter** - Choose from existing promoters
2. **Select Parties** - Choose employer and client
3. **Fill Contract Details** - Job title, department, salary, dates
4. **Generate Contract** - One click creates contract and triggers Make.com
