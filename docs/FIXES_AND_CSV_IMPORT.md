# Promoter-Employer Assignment Fixes & CSV Bulk Import System

## Overview

This document describes the fixes for promoter-employer assignment mismatches and the new CSV bulk import functionality added to the Contract Management System.

---

## üîß Problem 1: Promoter-Employer Assignment Mismatches

### Issue Description
Promoters were showing as assigned to employers (`employer_id` field populated) but had **zero contracts** in the database. This created a data integrity issue where:
- The UI showed promoters as employed
- No actual contract evidence existed
- Reports and analytics were incorrect
- Compliance issues could arise

### Root Cause
The `promoters.employer_id` field can be set independently of creating a contract record. This led to "orphaned" assignments where:
1. A promoter is assigned to an employer
2. No contract record is created
3. Data becomes inconsistent

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Database Diagnostic Script**
**File:** `scripts/fix-orphaned-promoters-detailed.sql`

This comprehensive SQL script provides:

**Diagnostic Features:**
- Counts total orphaned promoters
- Lists all orphaned promoters with details
- Shows employer distribution
- Categorizes by age (new/recent/old)

**Fix Options:**
- **Option A**: Create placeholder contracts for all orphaned promoters
- **Option B**: Remove employer assignments (mark as errors)
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach (create contracts for recent, remove old)

**Prevention Trigger:**
- Automatically warns when promoters are assigned without contracts
- Helps prevent future orphaned assignments

#### 2. **UI Warning System**
**File:** `app/[locale]/manage-promoters/[id]/page.tsx`

Added a prominent warning alert in the Professional tab that:
- Detects orphaned promoter assignments
- Shows a clear error message
- Provides two action buttons:
  - **Create Contract Now**: Redirects to contract creation
  - **Remove Assignment**: Clears the invalid employer assignment

**Example Warning:**
```tsx
‚ö†Ô∏è Data Integrity Issue: No Contract Found

This promoter is assigned to an employer but has no contract on file.
This is a data integrity issue that should be resolved.

[Create Contract Now] [Remove Assignment]
```

## üì• Problem 2: Bulk Data Import

### Issue Description
No way to bulk import data for:
- Promoters
- Parties (Employers/Clients/Vendors)
- Locations
- Products

Manual entry was time-consuming and error-prone for large datasets.

### Solution Implemented

Created a comprehensive CSV import system with validation, error handling, and user-friendly interfaces.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Fixing Orphaned Promoters

#### Option 1: Using SQL Script (Recommended for Bulk)

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Load `scripts/fix-orphaned-promoters-detailed.sql`
3. Run the diagnostic section first to see the problem scope
4. Choose ONE fix option (A, B, or C) and uncomment it
5. Run the script
6. Verify with the verification query at the end

**Example Workflow:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Run diagnostic (automatic - shows statistics)
-- Step 2: Review the detailed list of orphaned promoters
-- Step 3: Decide which option to use
-- Step 4: Uncomment chosen option (e.g., Option C - Hybrid)
-- Step 5: Run the script
-- Step 6: Check verification report
```

#### Option 2: Using UI (Recommended for Individual Cases)

1. Navigate to a promoter's detail page
2. Click on the "Professional" tab
3. If orphaned, you'll see the warning alert
4. Choose an action:
   - **Create Contract**: Creates a proper employment contract
   - **Remove Assignment**: Clears the employer reference

### Importing Data via CSV

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

1. Navigate to `/{locale}/csv-import`
2. Select the tab for what you want to import
3. Click "Download CSV Template"
4. Open the template in Excel or Google Sheets
5. Fill in your data following the examples

**Important Rules:**
- Keep the exact column headers
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates
- For employer/supplier references, use exact names
- Required fields must be filled
- Optional fields can be left empty

#### Step 2: Import Order (Important!)

Follow this sequence to avoid reference errors:

1. **Parties** (Employers, Clients, Vendors) - First!
2. **Locations** (Stores, Offices, Sites)
3. **Products** (references vendors from Step 1)
4. **Promoters** (references employers from Step 1)

#### Step 3: Upload and Validate

1. Click "Upload CSV File"
2. Select your prepared CSV file
3. Review validation results:
   - **Green**: Valid rows ready to import
   - **Red**: Invalid rows with error messages
4. Fix any errors in your CSV and re-upload

#### Step 4: Import

1. Click "Import [N] Records"
2. Watch the progress bar
3. Review import results:
   - Success count
   - Failure count
   - Error details for failed rows

#### Step 5: Verify

- Navigate to the relevant section (Promoters, Parties, etc.)
- Verify your imported data appears correctly
- Check any failed rows and fix issues

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common CSV Import Issues

**Issue: "Employer not found"**
- **Cause**: Employer doesn't exist in parties table
- **Fix**: Import parties (employers) first, then promoters

**Issue: "Invalid date format"**
- **Cause**: Date not in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Fix**: Convert dates to 2024-12-31 format (not 12/31/2024)

**Issue: "Required field missing"**
- **Cause**: Required columns left empty
- **Fix**: Fill in name_en, name_ar, id_card_number (for promoters)

**Issue: "Duplicate ID card number"**
- **Cause**: Promoter with same ID already exists
- **Fix**: Update existing promoter instead of importing duplicate

**Issue: "Too many errors"**
- **Cause**: File structure doesn't match template
- **Fix**: Download fresh template and start over

### Common Orphaned Promoter Issues

**Issue: "Cannot remove assignment"**
- **Cause**: Database permissions or connection issue
- **Fix**: Check user role (must be admin) and database connection

**Issue: "Promoter still shows as orphaned after fix"**
- **Cause**: Page cache not refreshed
- **Fix**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## üìä Statistics & Monitoring

### Monitoring Orphaned Promoters

Run this query weekly in Supabase:

```sql
-- Count current orphaned promoters
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphan_count
FROM (
  SELECT p.id
  FROM promoters p
  LEFT JOIN contracts c ON c.promoter_id = p.id
  WHERE p.status = 'active'
    AND p.employer_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY p.id
  HAVING COUNT(c.id) = 0
) orphans;
```

**Target**: 0 orphaned promoters

### Import Statistics

After each import session, check:
- Total rows processed
- Success rate
- Common error patterns
- Data quality metrics

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Data Imports

1. **Start Small**: Test with 5-10 rows first
2. **Validate First**: Always review validation before importing
3. **Follow Order**: Import parties before promoters
4. **Backup First**: Export existing data before bulk operations
5. **Check Results**: Verify data after each import
6. **Fix Errors**: Don't ignore validation warnings

### For Promoter Assignments

1. **Always Create Contract**: When assigning promoter to employer
2. **Review Regularly**: Check for orphaned assignments monthly
3. **Use UI Warnings**: Act on warnings when they appear
4. **Document Changes**: Add notes when removing assignments
5. **Verify Contract**: Ensure contract exists after assignment
