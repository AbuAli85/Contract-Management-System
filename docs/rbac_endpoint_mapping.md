## Implementation Notes

### Permission Inheritance

Some endpoints support multiple permission levels:

- **Own Resources**: User can only access their own resources
- **Provider Access**: User can access resources within their provider organization
- **Organization Access**: User can access resources within their company
- **All Access**: User can access any resource (admin level)

### Context Requirements

For context-based permissions, the following parameters are required:

```typescript
{
  user: { id: string, provider_id?: string, organization_id?: string },
  params: { id?: string, [key: string]: any },
  resourceType: string,
  resourceId?: string
}
```

### Default Permissions

- **Public endpoints**: No authentication required
- **Authenticated endpoints**: User must be logged in
- **Protected endpoints**: User must have specific permissions
- **Admin endpoints**: User must have admin-level permissions

### Permission Validation

All permissions are validated against:

1. **User authentication**: User must be logged in
2. **Role assignment**: User must have assigned roles
3. **Permission mapping**: Role must include required permission
4. **Scope validation**: Permission scope must match context
5. **Resource ownership**: User must own or have access to resource

### Error Responses

When permission is denied:

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions",
  "required_permission": "user:view:all",
  "reason": "User does not have required permission"
}
```

### Audit Logging

All permission checks are logged with:

- User ID
- Required permission
- Result (ALLOW/DENY/WOULD_BLOCK)
- IP address
- User agent
- Timestamp
- Context information

## Adding New Endpoints

When adding new endpoints:

1. **Define required permission** using `{resource}:{action}:{scope}` format
2. **Add to this mapping** with endpoint, method, and permission
3. **Implement permission check** using `guardPermission()` or `withRBAC()`
4. **Test permission enforcement** in both dry-run and enforce modes
5. **Update documentation** with usage examples

## Testing Permissions

Test permission enforcement:

```bash
# Test in dry-run mode
RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=dry-run npm run dev

# Test in enforce mode
RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=enforce npm run dev

# Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE event_type = 'PERMISSION_CHECK' ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```
=======
### Proposed Endpoint тЖТ Permission Mapping

- GET /api/bookings тЖТ booking:read:own (booking:read:provider for provider views; booking:read:all for admin dashboards)
- POST /api/bookings тЖТ booking:create:own
- GET /api/provider/services тЖТ service:read:own (manager/admin may need service:read:all)
- POST /api/provider/services тЖТ service:create:own
- GET /api/users тЖТ user:read:all (admin-only views)
- POST /api/users/:id/roles (future) тЖТ role:assign:all (scoped by org in evaluator)
- Moderation: service/message moderation routes тЖТ service:moderate:all | message:moderate:all

Notes:
- Ambiguous endpoints will default to most restrictive mapping and be flagged during review.
- Existing `professionalSecurityMiddleware` remains; RBAC runs in dry-run initially to audit.
