## 📋 **SUMMARY TABLE**

| What You See | Action Needed |
|--------------|---------------|
| ✅ Attendance interface works | **Skip** "Add Team Member" → Just assign to groups |
| ❌ "Attendance Not Available" | **Add** them first → Then assign to groups |
| ❌ Not in list at all | **Add** them first → Then assign to groups |

## 🎯 **BOTTOM LINE**

**If team members are already showing AND the Attendance tab works:**
- ✅ **No need to add them again**

- The Attendance tab shows an error
