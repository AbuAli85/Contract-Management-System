## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Task 1: Codebase Validation ‚úÖ

**Deliverable:** `DEEP_CODE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md`

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Metrics API endpoint **exists and works** (`/api/dashboard/promoter-metrics`)
- ‚úÖ Metrics bug **already fixed** (uses system-wide database queries)
- ‚úÖ Sortable columns **already implemented** (clickable headers with sort indicators)
- ‚úÖ Bulk actions **already connected** (handlers exist and work)
- ‚úÖ Filter dropdowns **properly coded** (all options hardcoded correctly)
- ‚úÖ Grid/Cards views **properly implemented** (full components with data)
