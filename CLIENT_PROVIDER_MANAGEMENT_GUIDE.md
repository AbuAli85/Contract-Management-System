# 🏢 Client & Provider Management System Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide will help you implement a comprehensive client and provider management system that creates attractive relationships between clients, providers, and promoters in your Contract Management System.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 📊 Database Structure

The system uses the existing `parties` table with enhanced relationships:

```
parties (Clients & Providers)
├── Basic Information (name_en, name_ar, crn)
├── Contact Details (contact_person, email, phone)
├── Business Information (cr_expiry, license_expiry)
├── Status Management (status, overall_status)
└── Relationships
    ├── → promoters (employees/contractors)
    ├── → contracts (active agreements)
    └── → contacts (multiple contact persons)
```

### 🔗 Key Relationships

1. **Client ↔ Provider**: Business partnerships and service agreements
