# Quick Test Guide - Contracts API Fix

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open the All Contracts Page
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/en/contracts**

### Step 3: Verify
- ✅ Page loads (no 404 error)
- ✅ Contracts list displays
- ✅ No console errors

## 📋 What Was Fixed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ `/api/contracts` returned 404 | ✅ Returns contracts list |
| ❌ "All Contracts" page broken | ✅ Page loads correctly |
| ❌ API in `contracts.disabled` folder | ✅ API in `contracts` folder |

## 🎯 API Endpoints Available

```
GET    /api/contracts          → List all contracts
POST   /api/contracts          → Create contract
GET    /api/contracts/[id]     → Get specific contract
PUT    /api/contracts/[id]     → Update contract
DELETE /api/contracts/[id]     → Delete contract
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

When you visit `/en/contracts`:
1. **No 404 Error** - Page loads
2. **Contracts Display** - Table shows data
3. **Stats Show** - Active, pending, expired counts
4. **No Console Errors** - Clean browser console

## 🔒 Security Note

If you see 401 Unauthorized:
- ✅ This is CORRECT - means authentication is working
- Just log in with your credentials
- The API is protected by RBAC
