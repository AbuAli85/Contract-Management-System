## 🏆 PART 1: Security Fixes (Morning)

### First Security Round - MFA & Auth

**Time:** 2 hours  
**Files Modified:** 6 files

✅ Fixed MFA bypass vulnerability (added otplib)  
✅ Fixed production auth service Promise issue  
✅ Fixed service-role exposure in bookings API

## 🧹 PART 2: Project Cleanup (Midday)

### Massive Cleanup Operation

**Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Files Removed:** 350+ files

**What Was Cleaned:**

- 87 redundant documentation files
- 180 unnecessary scripts
- 25 test files from root
- 17 duplicate SQL files
- 14 deploy script duplicates
- 11 sample data files
- 3 backup files

**Result:**

- Root directory: 100+ files → 49 files
- Scripts folder: 180+ files → 5 files
- Clean, organized structure

**Documentation Created:**

- ✅ Rewrote comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Created CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md

## 🛡️ PART 3: Promoters & Contracts Security (Afternoon)

### Second Security Round - Data Access

**Time:** 3.5 hours  
**Files Modified:** 3 files

#### Fix 1: RBAC Guards on Promoters ✅

- Added `withRBAC('promoter:create')` to POST
- Added `withRBAC('promoter:update')` to PUT
- Added `withRBAC('promoter:delete')` to DELETE

#### Fix 2: Promoter Query Scoping ✅

- Non-admins only see own promoters
- Admin sees all promoters
- Proper role checking

#### Fix 3: Service-Role Removed from Contracts ✅ (CRITICAL!)

- Removed SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY usage
- Now using authenticated client with RLS
- Added created_by tracking

#### Fix 4: Contract Query Scoping ✅

- Users only see contracts they're involved in
- Applied to both party and general queries
- Admin sees all contracts

**Result:** 🔴 CRITICAL risk → 🟢 LOW risk

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Run `npm install` (for otplib)
- [ ] Run `npm test`
- [ ] Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run `npm run build`
- [ ] Manual testing of critical flows:
  - [ ] User registration (can't select admin)
  - [ ] MFA setup and login
  - [ ] Promoter isolation (User A can't see User B)
  - [ ] Contract isolation (User A can't see User B)
  - [ ] RBAC enforcement (403 without permissions)
  - [ ] Admin can see all records

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Security

1. **Never use service-role in client APIs** - Critical vulnerability
2. **Always scope queries to user** - Prevent data leaks
3. **Use RBAC wrappers consistently** - Enforce permissions
4. **Track ownership explicitly** - Add created_by fields
5. **Test security thoroughly** - Don't rely on UI alone

### Development

1. **Clean as you go** - Don't accumulate technical debt
2. **Document security changes** - Use clear comments
3. **Fix linter errors immediately** - Prevents cascading issues
4. **Version control > backup files** - Use git properly
5. **Consolidate documentation** - One source of truth
