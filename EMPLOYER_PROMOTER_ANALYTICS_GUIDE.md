## How to Access

1. Navigate to `/analytics/employer-promoters` in your browser
2. Or click on "Employer Analytics" from the main analytics menu

## How Promoters Are Linked to Employers

The system determines employer-promoter relationships through:

1. **Direct Assignment**: Promoters with `employer_id` field set
2. **Contract Association**: Promoters linked through contracts where the employer is either:
   - The `employer_id` in the contract
   - The `first_party_id` in the contract

## Document Images

### Viewing Documents
- Click on any ID card or passport image to view it in full size in a new tab
- Images are hosted on Supabase Storage for secure, fast access
- Missing documents are clearly indicated with placeholder graphics

### Document Security
- All document images are served through secure URLs
- Access is controlled through Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Images can only be accessed by authorized users

## API Endpoint

The feature uses an optimized API endpoint for better performance:

```
GET /api/analytics/employer-promoters
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "employers": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "name_en": "...",
        "name_ar": "...",
        "promoters": [...],
        "promoterCount": 5
      }
    ],

      "totalEmployers": 18,
      "totalPromoters": 85,
      "avgPromotersPerEmployer": 4.7
    }

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

**Solution**: Check that:
1. Employers exist in the parties table with `type='Employer'`
2. Promoters have valid `employer_id` references or contract associations
3. Database RLS policies allow reading promoters and parties

### Images Not Loading

**Solution**: Verify that:
1. Image URLs are valid and accessible
2. Supabase Storage bucket has correct permissions
3. Images were uploaded to the correct storage path
4. Network connectivity to Supabase is working

### Slow Loading

**Solution**:
1. Check database indexes on `promoters.employer_id` and `contracts` foreign keys
2. Verify API endpoint is responding quickly
3. Consider implementing pagination for large datasets
4. Check network latency to database
