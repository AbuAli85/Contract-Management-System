# Promoter Management System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: Form components included many fields that don't exist in the actual database schema
**Fix**: Updated `promoter-form-professional.tsx` to only include fields that exist in the database:
