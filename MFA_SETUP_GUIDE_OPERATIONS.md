## 🔑 HOW MFA WORKS

### Login Process After MFA:

```
1. Enter email: operations@falconeyegroup.net
2. Enter password: ************
   ↓
3. System asks for 6-digit code
   ↓
4. Open authenticator app on phone
5. See code: 123456 (changes every 30 seconds)
   ↓
6. Enter code: 123456
   ↓
7. ✅ Access granted!
```

### Why TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)?

- **Secure:** Codes expire every 30 seconds
- **Offline:** Works without internet
- **Standard:** Industry-standard protocol
- **Reliable:** 99.99% uptime

## ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Q: Lost my phone / Can't access authenticator app?

**A:** Use a backup code!
1. When prompted for MFA code, look for "Use backup code" link
2. Enter one of your 8 backup codes
3. That code will be consumed (single-use)
4. You'll have 7 remaining codes

**Important:** After using backup codes, regenerate new ones and set up MFA on a new device.

### Q: Backup codes lost too?

**A:** Contact the other admin:
- Email: luxsess2001@gmail.com
- User: Fahad alamri
- They can temporarily disable your MFA so you can set up new codes

### Q: Code says "invalid" or "incorrect"?

**A:** Common causes:
1. **Time sync issue** - Make sure your phone's time is auto-synced
2. **Old code** - Codes change every 30 seconds, use the current one
3. **Wrong account** - Make sure you're viewing the correct entry in your app

### Q: Can I use SMS instead of an app?

**A:** Not currently implemented, but you can:
1. Use authenticator app (recommended)
2. Use backup codes as fallback
3. Request phone number-based 2FA (future feature)
