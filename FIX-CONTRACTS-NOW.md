# 🚀 Quick Fix Guide - Generate All Contract PDFs

## ⚡ FASTEST PATH TO FIX

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable (1 minute)

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
MAKECOM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.eu2.make.com/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID_HERE
```

**Where to get YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID:**
1. Login to Make.com
2. Open your contract generation scenario
3. Copy the webhook URL from the "Webhook" trigger module

### Step 2: Test with 1 Contract (3 minutes)

```bash
npx tsx scripts/batch-generate-contract-pdfs.ts --limit=1
```

Wait 2 minutes, then verify:
```sql
SELECT contract_number, status, pdf_url 
FROM contracts 
WHERE pdf_url IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Generate All PDFs (90 minutes)

```bash
npx tsx scripts/batch-generate-contract-pdfs.ts
```

The script will:
- ✅ Process 218 contracts
- ✅ Show real-time progress
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Provide summary report

## 🔍 If You Don't Have Make.com Webhook URL

### Option 1: Find it in Make.com
1. Go to https://www.make.com/
2. Login to your account
3. Find "Contract Generation" scenario
4. Click on the Webhook module
5. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/xxxxxxxxx`)

### Option 2: Check Existing Code
The webhook URL might already be in your environment. Check:

```bash
# PowerShell
Get-Content .env.local | Select-String "WEBHOOK"
```

Look for lines like:
```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.eu2.make.com/71go2x4zwsnha4r1f4en1g9gjxpk3ts4
MAKECOM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.eu2.make.com/71go2x4zwsnha4r1f4en1g9gjxpk3ts4
```

### Option 3: Create New Webhook
1. Go to Make.com
2. Create a new scenario
3. Add "Webhooks > Custom webhook" module
4. Copy the generated URL
5. Configure the scenario to:
   - Receive contract data
   - Generate PDF from Google Docs template
   - Call back to: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhook/contract-pdf-ready`

## ⚠️ PREREQUISITES

Before running the script, ensure:

- [ ] ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is set
- [ ] ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
- [ ] ⚠️ `MAKECOM_WEBHOOK_URL` is set (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] ⚠️ Make.com scenario is ACTIVE (not paused)
- [ ] ⚠️ Your app is deployed or running locally

## 📊 WHAT TO EXPECT

### During Execution (60-90 min):
```
🚀 Batch Contract PDF Generation Script
========================================

📊 Configuration:
   Supabase URL: https://reootcngcptfogfozlmz.supabase.co
   Make.com Webhook: https://hook.eu2.make.com/xxx...
   Status Filter: draft,pending,active

📋 Step 1: Fetching contracts without PDFs...

Found 218 contracts without PDFs:

Status breakdown:
   draft: 153
   pending: 55
   active: 10

📄 Step 2: Generating PDFs for 218 contracts...

[1/218] Processing PAC-15102025-3302...
   ✅ Success - Status: triggered
[2/218] Processing PAC-15102025-8412...
   ✅ Success - Status: triggered
...
[218/218] Processing PAC-22102025-LAST...
   ✅ Success - Status: triggered

========================================
📊 Generation Complete!

✅ Successful: 215
❌ Failed: 3
📋 Total: 218

💡 Note: PDF generation happens asynchronously via Make.com.
   Check the contracts table in 5-10 minutes to see updated pdf_url values.
```

### After 5-10 Minutes:
PDFs will appear in contracts as Make.com completes processing.

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

### Check Progress:
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN pdf_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_pdf,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN pdf_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as success_rate
FROM contracts
GROUP BY status;
```

### Expected Results:
```
status    | total | with_pdf | success_rate
----------|-------|----------|-------------
completed | 150+  | 150+     | 100%
processing| 50+   | 0-50     | 0-100%
draft     | 0-10  | 0        | 0%
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS = 215+ Contracts with PDFs

**Target:** 98%+ success rate (215 out of 219)

**Why not 100%?**
- 4 contracts missing promoter_id (cannot generate without promoter)
- These need manual intervention to assign promoters first

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Missing MAKECOM_WEBHOOK_URL"
→ Add to .env.local (see Step 1)

### Error: "All webhook attempts failed"
→ Check Make.com scenario is Active (not Paused)

### Error: "Missing promoter data"
→ That contract has no promoter assigned, skip it

### PDFs not appearing after 10 minutes?
→ Check Make.com execution logs for errors
