## 🔧 **Quick Setup (3 Steps)**

### Step 1: Enable HTTP in Supabase

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS http;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA net TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
GRANT ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA net TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

### Step 2: Get Make.com Webhook URLs

1. Create scenarios in Make.com with webhook triggers
2. Copy the webhook URLs for each scenario:
   - Booking Created: `https://hook.eu1.make.com/abc123/booking-created`
   - Status Changed: `https://hook.eu1.make.com/def456/booking-status-changed`
   - Payment: `https://hook.eu1.make.com/ghi789/payment-processed`
   - etc.

### Step 3: Deploy the Integration

1. Edit `setup-supabase-webhooks.sql` and replace the placeholder URLs with your real Make.com URLs
2. Run the entire script in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Test with `test-webhook-integration.sql`

## 📋 **Testing Your Integration**

### Manual Test

```sql
-- Test webhook call
SELECT safe_webhook_call(
  'https://hook.eu1.make.com/your-webhook-id',
  '{"test": "data"}'::jsonb
);
```

### Live Test

```sql
-- Create a test booking (will automatically trigger webhook)
INSERT INTO bookings (
  service_id, client_name, client_email,
  scheduled_start, scheduled_end, quoted_price, status
) VALUES (
  'your-service-id', 'Test Client', 'test@example.com',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '1 day', NOW() + INTERVAL '1 day' + INTERVAL '1 hour',
  150.00, 'pending'
);
```

### Check Results

```sql
-- View webhook logs
SELECT webhook_type, status, created_at
FROM webhook_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
