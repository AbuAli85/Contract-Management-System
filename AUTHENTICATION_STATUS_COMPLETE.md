## 🚀 **HOW TO TEST YOUR AUTHENTICATION**

### **1. Test Login/Logout**
```bash
# Visit your login page
http://localhost:3000/en/auth/login

# Try to access protected pages without login
http://localhost:3000/en/dashboard
# Should redirect to login page

# After login, try to access admin features
# Should be blocked if user doesn't have admin role
```

### **2. Test API Security**
```bash
# Test unauthenticated API access
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
# Should return 401 Unauthorized

# Test with authentication
# Should work with proper session cookies
```

### **3. Test Permission System**
```bash
# Visit user management as non-admin user
http://localhost:3000/en/user-management
# Should show "Access Denied" message

# Admin users should have full access
# Regular users should have limited access
```
