-- Temporarily disable RLS for app_users table to fix permission issues
-- This is a temporary solution for development/testing

-- Disable RLS on app_users table
ALTER TABLE app_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'app_users';

-- Show current policies (should be none active)
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'app_users';

-- Grant all permissions to authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON app_users TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE app_users_id_seq TO authenticated;

-- Insert a default admin user if none exists
INSERT INTO app_users (email, role, status, full_name)
SELECT 'admin@example.com', 'admin', 'active', 'System Administrator'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM app_users WHERE email = 'admin@example.com');

-- Show current users
SELECT id, email, role, status, created_at FROM app_users ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Note: To re-enable RLS later, run:
-- ALTER TABLE app_users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Then recreate the policies as needed
