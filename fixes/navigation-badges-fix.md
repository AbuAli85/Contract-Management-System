# Fix: Remove Misleading Navigation Badges

## Issue
All navigation items display sequential badge numbers (3-16), which users may confuse with notification counts.

## Root Cause
These badges appear to be development artifacts or debugging elements that were not removed.

## Solution

### Step 1: Locate Navigation Component

The navigation is likely in one of these files:
- `components/authenticated-layout.tsx`
- `components/sidebar.tsx`
- `components/navigation.tsx`

### Step 2: Find and Remove Badge Elements

Search for badge components in the navigation. Look for patterns like:

```typescript
<Badge>{number}</Badge>
```

or

```typescript
<span className="badge">{number}</span>
```

### Step 3: Remove or Conditionally Render Badges

**Option 1: Remove completely**

Simply delete the badge elements from the navigation items.

**Option 2: Make conditional (recommended for future use)**

Replace static numbers with actual notification counts:

```typescript
{notificationCount > 0 && <Badge>{notificationCount}</Badge>}
```

## Example Fix

**Before:**
```typescript
<NavItem href="/promoters" icon={Users}>
  Promoters
  <Badge>14</Badge>
</NavItem>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<NavItem href="/promoters" icon={Users}>
  Promoters
  {/* Badge removed - add back when real notifications are implemented */}
</NavItem>
```

## Verification

1. Check all navigation items
2. Verify badges are no longer visible
3. If conditional rendering is used, verify badges appear only when there are actual notifications
