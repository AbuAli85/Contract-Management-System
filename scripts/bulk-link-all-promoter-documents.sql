-- üîß INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX:
-- ============================================================================
-- 1. Review Step 3 (ID Card Matches) and Step 4 (Passport Matches)
-- 2. For each match that looks correct, copy the UPDATE statement and run it
-- 3. Or, run all UPDATE statements at once if matches look accurate
-- 4. For promoters in Step 5 (no matches), manually find files and update
-- 5. After updates, verify with the query below
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- ‚úÖ VERIFICATION QUERY (Run after updates):
-- ============================================================================
-- SELECT 
--   id,
--   name_en,
--   id_card_url,
--   passport_url,
--   CASE WHEN id_card_url LIKE 'https://%' THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as id_card_ok,
--   CASE WHEN passport_url LIKE 'https://%' THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as passport_ok
-- FROM promoters
-- ORDER BY name_en;
