-- ============================================================================
-- üß™ MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
-- ============================================================================
-- After running this script:
-- 
-- 1. Copy one of the "correct_*_url" values from Step 5
-- 2. Open an INCOGNITO/PRIVATE browser window
-- 3. Paste the URL and press Enter
-- 4. If you see the image WITHOUT login prompt = SUCCESS ‚úÖ
-- 5. If you get "403 Forbidden" or login prompt = FAILURE ‚ùå
-- 
-- If test fails, the issue is NOT with Make.com but with Supabase setup.
-- If test succeeds, the issue is with the URL being sent to Make.com Module 6.
