# ✅ Test: Manage Promoters - Post-Fix Verification

## 🎉 Permissions Successfully Granted!

The SQL script completed successfully. Now let's verify the fix works.

## 🧪 Test Steps

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (Important!)

**Option A: Hard Refresh**
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Option B: Clear Site Data**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Option C: Incognito/Private Window**
- Open a new incognito/private window
- Log in again
- Test the page

### Step 2: Navigate to Manage Promoters

Go to: **`/en/manage-promoters`**

### Step 3: Expected Results ✅

You should see:

1. **Loading spinner** (briefly)
2. **Page heading**: "Promoter Management"
3. **Promoters list** with data:
   - Name (English & Arabic)
   - ID card number
   - Status
   - Employer information
4. **No error messages**
5. **Clean console** (no 403/404 errors)

### Step 4: Check Browser Console

**Open Console**: F12 → Console tab

**Expected logs:**
```
🚀 PromoterManagement component mounted
🔄 useEffect triggered
📡 Fetching promoters...
📡 Response status: 200 OK
📡 API Response: { success: true, count: X }
📊 Promoters data: X items
```

**No errors** like:
- ❌ 403 Forbidden
- ❌ 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ Permission denied

### Step 5: Check Network Tab

**Open Network Tab**: F12 → Network

1. Filter by "promoters"
2. Look for `/api/promoters` request
3. **Status should be**: `200 OK`
4. **Response should show**: Promoter data JSON

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Promoters list is visible
- [ ] Console shows 200 OK status
- [ ] No permission errors in console
- [ ] Network tab shows successful API call
- [ ] Can see promoter details (name, status, etc.)

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Issue 1: Still Getting Permission Error

**Try this:**

1. **Log out and log back in**
   ```
   Settings → Logout → Login again
   ```

2. **Check your user has the permission**
   Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Check current user's permissions
   SELECT 
     p.email,
     r.name as role,
     perm.name as permission
   FROM profiles p
   JOIN user_role_assignments ura ON p.id = ura.user_id
   JOIN roles r ON ura.role_id = r.id
   JOIN role_permissions rp ON r.id = rp.role_id
   JOIN permissions perm ON rp.permission_id = perm.id
   WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
     AND perm.resource = 'promoter';
   ```

   Should show: `promoter:read:own` and `promoter:manage:own`

3. **Clear all cookies**
   - DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data

### Issue 2: Page Loads But Shows "No promoters found"

This means:
- ✅ Permissions are working
- ❌ No promoter data in database

**Check database:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM promoters;
```

If count is 0, you need to add promoters first.

### Issue 3: Still Getting 403 Error

**Possible causes:**

1. **Cache issue** - Try incognito mode
2. **Wrong user** - Make sure you're logged in as the test user
3. **RBAC enforcement** - Check `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Should NOT have this in development:
   RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=enforce
   ```

**Fix for development:**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
RBAC_ENFORCEMENT=dry-run
```

Then restart dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Issue 4: Getting Different Error

**Share these details:**
1. Screenshot of error message
2. Browser console output
3. Network tab for `/api/promoters` request
4. Result of permission check query (above)

## 📊 Comparison Test

### Also Test: All Promoters Page

Navigate to: **`/en/promoters`**

**Both pages should now work:**
- ✅ `/en/promoters` (All Promoters)
- ✅ `/en/manage-promoters` (Manage Promoters)

If one works but not the other, there's still a permission issue.

## 🎯 Performance Check

The page should load:
- **Initial load**: < 2 seconds
- **API response**: < 1 second
- **Smooth**: No lag or freezing

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Manage Promoters page accessible
- [ ] Promoter data displays correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] API returns 200 status
- [ ] User has promoter:read:own permission
- [ ] All Promoters page also works
- [ ] Can navigate between pages smoothly
- [ ] Error messages (if any) are helpful

## 📸 Screenshot the Success

Take a screenshot showing:
1. URL: `/en/manage-promoters`
2. Page with promoter data visible
3. Console with no errors
4. Network tab showing 200 OK

This confirms the fix worked!
