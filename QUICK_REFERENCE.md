# Pending Contracts Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 Critical Issue
Pending contracts page showed perpetual loading without displaying contracts or errors.

### ✅ Root Cause
API endpoint wasn't filtering by status parameter - it fetched ALL contracts instead of just pending ones.

---

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Check if Pending Contracts Load
```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/en/contracts/pending

# Expected: See contracts or "No Pending Contracts" message
```

### 2. Verify Console Logs

**Browser Console (F12):**
```
✅ Loaded pending contracts: { count: 3, queryTime: '245ms', ... }
```

**Server Logs:**
```
🔍 Filtering contracts by status: pending
📊 Query execution: { status: 'pending', queryTime: '123ms', resultCount: 3 }
✅ Contracts API: Successfully fetched 3 contracts
```

- After 3s: "This is taking longer than expected..."
- After 10s: Timeout error with retry button

### 🔄 Error Recovery
- **Retry Button**: Quick retry without page refresh
- **View All Contracts**: Fallback navigation option
- **Clear Messages**: Specific error descriptions

### 📝 Debug Logging
- Request timing tracked
- Permission checks logged
- API response metrics
- Sample IDs for debugging

## Files Changed

1. **`app/api/contracts/route.ts`**
   - Added status filtering (lines 117-130)
   - Enhanced query logging (lines 139-151, 408-418)

2. **`app/[locale]/contracts/pending/page.tsx`**
   - Added timeout logic (lines 68-161)
   - Progressive loading UI (lines 275-288)
   - Enhanced error handling (lines 303-323)
   - Better empty states (lines 352-372)

## Console Commands for Debugging

### Check Current Implementation
```bash
# Search for status filtering in API
grep -n "status === 'pending'" app/api/contracts/route.ts

# Check timeout implementation
grep -n "AbortController" app/[locale]/contracts/pending/page.tsx
```

### Monitor Logs in Real-Time
```bash
# Watch for API calls
npm run dev | grep "Contracts API"

# Filter for pending status
npm run dev | grep "pending"
```

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Fix:** Ensure user has `contract:read:own` permission or admin role

### Issue: No contracts showing but dashboard shows count
**Fix:** Check if contract statuses include 'pending', 'legal_review', etc.

### Issue: Timeout after 10 seconds
**Fix:** 
1. Check database connection
2. Verify query performance
3. Check RLS policies

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Fetches ALL contracts | Fetches ONLY pending |
| No timeout | 10s timeout |
| No user feedback | Progressive messages |
| Generic errors | Specific error messages |
| Basic logging | Comprehensive debugging |

## Next Steps (Optional)

- [ ] Add real-time polling for updates
- [ ] Implement React Query for caching
- [ ] Add pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Add filters by approval stage
- [ ] Email notifications for stuck contracts
