feat: Consolidate promoters pages and fix navigation

BREAKING CHANGE: /manage-promoters now redirects to /promoters

## Summary
Consolidated the promoters management system by making the Intelligence Hub
(/promoters) the primary page and converting /manage-promoters/[id] to the 
detail view. This eliminates confusion, fixes data display issues, and 
provides a unified experience.

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Very Basic UI - Now redirects to feature-rich Intelligence Hub
2. ✅ Inconsistent Count (50 vs 112) - Intelligence Hub shows correct pagination
3. ✅ No Visual Design - Three beautiful view modes (Table/Grid/Cards)
4. ✅ Status Value "Cancel" - Color-coded status badges
5. ✅ No Document Status - Document status visible in all views
6. ✅ No Contact Information - Email and phone shown in all views
7. ✅ Pagination Issues - Full pagination with controls
