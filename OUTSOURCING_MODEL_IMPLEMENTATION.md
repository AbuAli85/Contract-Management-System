# Outsourcing Model Implementation Guide

## Business Model Confirmed ✅

Your diagnostic results prove you have a **staffing agency/outsourcing business model**:

### Real-World Example from Your Data

**Shahmeer Abdul Sattar**:
- **Employed by**: Amjad Al Maerifa LLC (payroll, benefits, HR)
- **Works at**: Blue Oasis Quality Services (client site)
- **5 Active Contracts**: Total value 10,800 OMR
  - Blue Oasis: 3 contracts (6,600 OMR)
  - AL AMRI: 2 contracts (4,200 OMR)

This is **common in recruitment/staffing agencies** where:
1. Agency employs the worker (employer of record)
2. Worker is placed at client company
3. Client pays agency, agency pays worker

---

## Current Schema Ambiguity

### The Problem

Your database uses `employer_id` for two different concepts:

```sql
promoters table:
  employer_id → Who employs them (staffing agency)

contracts table:
  employer_id → Where they work (client company)
```

**Same column name, different meanings!** This causes confusion.

---

## Recommended Solution: Schema Enhancement

### Add Explicit Client Company Field

```sql
-- Migration: 20251022_add_client_company_to_contracts.sql

-- Step 1: Add new column for clarity
ALTER TABLE contracts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS client_company_id UUID REFERENCES parties(id);

-- Step 2: Migrate existing data
-- For contracts where employer_id doesn't match promoter's employer,
-- the contract.employer_id is actually the CLIENT company
UPDATE contracts c
SET client_company_id = c.employer_id,
    employer_id = p.employer_id
FROM promoters p
WHERE c.promoter_id::uuid = p.id
  AND c.employer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND p.employer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND c.employer_id != p.employer_id;

-- Step 3: Add helpful comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN contracts.employer_id IS 'The company that employs the promoter (employer of record, pays salary)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN contracts.client_company_id IS 'The client company where the promoter works (outsourced location)';

-- Step 4: Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contracts_client_company ON contracts(client_company_id);
```

### Result

After migration, your data becomes:

| Promoter | Employer (Payroll) | Client (Work Location) | Clarity |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Shahmeer | Amjad Al Maerifa LLC | Blue Oasis Quality Services | ✅ Clear |
| Abdul Basit | Falcon Eye Modern Investments | Amjad Al Maerifa LLC | ✅ Clear |
| Abdelrhman | Falcon Eye Business | Amjad Al Maerifa LLC | ✅ Clear |

---

## UI Enhancements

### 1. Contract Display - Show Both Companies

**Before** (Confusing):
```
Employer: Blue Oasis Quality Services
```

**After** (Clear):
```
Employer (Payroll): Amjad Al Maerifa LLC
Client (Work Location): Blue Oasis Quality Services
Type: Outsourced
```

### 2. Professional Tab - Breakdown

```tsx
// In app/[locale]/manage-promoters/[id]/page.tsx

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Contract Summary</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Primary Employer */}
      <div>
        <h4 className="font-semibold">Primary Employer</h4>
        <p>{promoterDetails.parties?.name_en}</p>
        <Badge>Employer of Record</Badge>
      </div>

      {/* Client Assignments */}
      <div>
        <h4 className="font-semibold">Client Assignments</h4>
        {clientCompanies.map(client => (
          <div key={client.id} className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 border rounded">
            <div>
              <p className="font-medium">{client.name}</p>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                {client.activeContracts} active contract(s)
              </p>
            </div>
            <Badge>{client.totalValue} OMR</Badge>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Contract Type Badge */}
      <Badge variant={hasClientAssignments ? 'secondary' : 'default'}>
        {hasClientAssignments ? 'Outsourced' : 'Direct Employment'}
      </Badge>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### 3. Contract Form - Clarify Selection

```tsx
// In contract generation form

<FormField
  name="employer_id"
  label="Employer (Who pays salary?)"
  description="Select the company responsible for payroll and benefits"
  required
/>

<FormField
  name="client_company_id"
  label="Client Company (Where do they work?)"
  description="Leave empty for direct employment, or select client for outsourcing"
  optional
/>

{clientCompanyId && clientCompanyId !== employerId && (
  <Alert>
    <Info className="h-4 w-4" />
    <AlertTitle>Outsourced Assignment</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
      This promoter is employed by {employerName} but will work at {clientName}.
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

---

## Updated Types

```typescript
// File: lib/types.ts

export interface Contract {
  id: string;
  contract_number: string;
  promoter_id: string;
  
  // Employment relationship
  employer_id?: string; // Company that employs (payroll)
  employer?: Party; // Populated employer data
  
  // Work location (for outsourcing)
  client_company_id?: string | null; // Where promoter works (if different)
  client_company?: Party | null; // Populated client data
  
  // Contract details
  title: string;
  contract_type: 'employment' | 'service' | 'consultancy' | 'partnership';
  status: 'draft' | 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'terminated' | 'expired';
  start_date: string;
  end_date?: string;
  value?: number;
  
  // Metadata
  is_outsourced?: boolean; // Computed: employer_id !== client_company_id
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface EnhancedContract extends Contract {
  is_outsourced: boolean;
  outsourcing_type?: 'direct' | 'outsourced' | 'secondment';
}
```

## Report Enhancements

### Dashboard Widget: Outsourcing Overview

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Employment Model Breakdown</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-2">
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <span>Direct Employment</span>
        <Badge>{directEmploymentCount}</Badge>
      </div>
      <div className="flex justify-between">
        <span>Outsourced to Clients</span>
        <Badge variant="secondary">{outsourcedCount}</Badge>
      </div>
      <Separator />
      <div className="flex justify-between font-semibold">

        <Badge variant="outline">{totalActive}</Badge>
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Client Revenue Report

```sql
-- Revenue by client company (for outsourced contracts)
SELECT 
    client.name_en as client_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.promoter_id) as promoters_assigned,
    COUNT(c.id) as active_contracts,
    SUM(c.value) as total_contract_value,
    AVG(c.value) as avg_contract_value
FROM contracts c
JOIN parties client ON client.id = c.client_company_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
  AND c.client_company_id IS NOT NULL

RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  promoter_employer_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Get promoter's employer
  SELECT employer_id INTO promoter_employer_id
  FROM promoters
  WHERE id = NEW.promoter_id::uuid;

  -- If contract employer doesn't match promoter employer
  IF promoter_employer_id IS NOT NULL 
     AND NEW.employer_id IS NOT NULL 
     AND promoter_employer_id != NEW.employer_id THEN
    
    -- If client_company_id is not set, automatically set it
    IF NEW.client_company_id IS NULL THEN
      NEW.client_company_id := NEW.employer_id;
      NEW.employer_id := promoter_employer_id;
      
      RAISE NOTICE 'Auto-corrected outsourcing: employer=%, client=%', 
        promoter_employer_id, NEW.client_company_id;
    END IF;

## Example Migration Script

```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251022_implement_outsourcing_model.sql

BEGIN;

-- Add client_company_id column
ALTER TABLE contracts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS client_company_id UUID REFERENCES parties(id);

-- Migrate existing outsourced contracts
-- Contracts where employer != promoter's employer are outsourced
UPDATE contracts c
SET 
  client_company_id = c.employer_id,  -- Current employer is actually client
  employer_id = p.employer_id,        -- Use promoter's employer
  updated_at = NOW()
FROM promoters p
WHERE c.promoter_id::uuid = p.id
  AND c.employer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND p.employer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND c.employer_id != p.employer_id
  AND c.status IN ('active', 'pending');

-- Add comments for clarity
COMMENT ON COLUMN contracts.employer_id IS 
  'Company that employs the promoter (employer of record, handles payroll and benefits)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN contracts.client_company_id IS 
  'Client company where promoter works (for outsourced/secondment arrangements). NULL for direct employment.';

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_contracts_client_company ON contracts(client_company_id);

-- Add computed column for easy querying
ALTER TABLE contracts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_outsourced BOOLEAN 
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  client_company_id IS NOT NULL AND client_company_id != employer_id
) STORED;

-- Validation trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_contract_outsourcing()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  promoter_employer_id UUID;
BEGIN
  SELECT employer_id INTO promoter_employer_id
  FROM promoters
  WHERE id = NEW.promoter_id::uuid;

  IF promoter_employer_id IS NOT NULL 
     AND NEW.employer_id IS NOT NULL 
     AND promoter_employer_id != NEW.employer_id 
     AND NEW.client_company_id IS NULL THEN
    
    NEW.client_company_id := NEW.employer_id;
    NEW.employer_id := promoter_employer_id;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Auto-corrected outsourcing for contract %', NEW.contract_number;
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER validate_contract_outsourcing_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON contracts
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_contract_outsourcing();

COMMIT;

-- Verification query
SELECT 
  'Total Contracts' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM contracts
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Direct Employment' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM contracts

## Quick Implementation (30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Migration (5 min)
```sql
-- Copy the migration SQL above
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Update API Response (10 min)

```typescript
// File: app/api/contracts/route.ts

// In the SELECT query, add:
.select(`
  *,
  employer:employer_id (id, name_en, name_ar, type),
  client:client_company_id (id, name_en, name_ar, type),
  promoter:promoter_id (id, name_en, name_ar, mobile_number)
`)

// In the response transformation:
const transformedContract = {
  ...contract,
  employer: contract.employer,
  client: contract.client || contract.employer, // Fallback to employer if direct
  is_outsourced: contract.is_outsourced,
  employment_type: contract.is_outsourced ? 'outsourced' : 'direct',
};
```

### Step 3: Update UI (15 min)

```tsx
// File: app/[locale]/contracts/page.tsx or similar

{contract.is_outsourced ? (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Building2 className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" />
      <div>
        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Employer (Payroll)</p>
        <p className="font-medium">{contract.employer?.name_en}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <MapPin className="h-4 w-4 text-green-600" />
      <div>
        <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Client (Work Location)</p>
        <p className="font-medium">{contract.client?.name_en}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <Badge variant="secondary">Outsourced</Badge>
  </div>
) : (
  <div>
    <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Employer</p>
    <p className="font-medium">{contract.employer?.name_en}</p>
    <Badge>Direct Employment</Badge>
  </div>
)}
```

## Analytics Queries

### Outsourcing Revenue by Client

```sql
SELECT 
    client.name_en as client_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.promoter_id) as promoters_assigned,
    COUNT(c.id) as contracts_count,
    SUM(c.value) as total_monthly_value,
    AVG(c.value) as avg_contract_value,
    MIN(c.start_date) as first_contract_date,
    MAX(c.end_date) as latest_contract_end
FROM contracts c
JOIN parties client ON client.id = c.client_company_id
WHERE c.is_outsourced = true
  AND c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY client.id, client.name_en
ORDER BY total_monthly_value DESC;
```

### Staffing Agency Performance

```sql
SELECT 
    employer.name_en as agency_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.promoter_id) as total_promoters_employed,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.client_company_id) as clients_served,
    SUM(c.value) as total_contract_value,
    COUNT(c.id) FILTER (WHERE c.is_outsourced = true) as outsourced_contracts,
    COUNT(c.id) FILTER (WHERE c.is_outsourced = false) as direct_contracts
FROM contracts c
JOIN parties employer ON employer.id = c.employer_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY employer.id, employer.name_en
ORDER BY total_promoters_employed DESC;
```
