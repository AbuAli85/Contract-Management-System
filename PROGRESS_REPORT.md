## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Step 1: Add RBAC Guards to Promoter Mutations ‚úÖ

**Status:** Complete  
**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/promoters/route.ts` - POST endpoint
- `app/api/promoters/[id]/route.ts` - PUT and DELETE endpoints

**Changes Made:**

1. ‚úÖ Wrapped POST with `withRBAC('promoter:create', ...)`
2. ‚úÖ Wrapped PUT with `withRBAC('promoter:update', ...)`
3. ‚úÖ Wrapped DELETE with `withRBAC('promoter:delete', ...)`

**Security Impact:**

- **Before:** Any authenticated user could create/update/delete ANY promoter
- **After:** Users must have specific permissions to perform mutations
- **Risk Reduced:** HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM (still need query scoping)

**Testing Required:**

- [ ] User without `promoter:create` cannot create promoters
- [ ] User without `promoter:update` cannot update promoters
- [ ] User without `promoter:delete` cannot delete promoters
- [ ] Admin with permissions can perform all operations
