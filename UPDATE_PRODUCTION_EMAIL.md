# ✅ Update Production Email Configuration

## 🎉 **Your Domain is Verified!**

`portal.thesmartpro.io` is verified in Resend! All DNS records are correct. ✅

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables**

Go to: **https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables**

**Update or Add:**

```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@portal.thesmartpro.io
RESEND_FROM_NAME=SmartPro Contract Management System
```

**Make sure to:**
- ✅ Select "Production" environment
- ✅ Click "Save"

### **Step 2: Update Local Environment (Optional)**

If testing locally, update `.env.local`:

```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@portal.thesmartpro.io
RESEND_FROM_NAME=SmartPro Contract Management System
```

Then restart your dev server.

### **Step 3: Redeploy**

The environment variable change requires a redeploy:

```bash
# Option 1: Trigger redeploy in Vercel dashboard
# Go to Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy

# Option 2: Push a commit (triggers auto-deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update email from address to verified domain"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ **AFTER UPDATING**

Your emails will:
- ✅ Come from `noreply@portal.thesmartpro.io` (professional!)
- ✅ Send to **ANY email address** (unlimited!)
- ✅ Have better deliverability (trusted domain)
- ✅ Look more professional to recipients

---

## 📧 **EMAIL ADDRESSES YOU CAN USE**

With your verified domain, you can use any address:

```env
# General notifications
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@portal.thesmartpro.io

# Contract-specific  
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contracts@portal.thesmartpro.io

# Notifications
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@portal.thesmartpro.io

# Support emails
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@portal.thesmartpro.io

# HR-related
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=hr@portal.thesmartpro.io
```

All of these will work! Choose whichever makes the most sense.

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED SETUP**

**For your use case, I recommend:**

```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@portal.thesmartpro.io
RESEND_FROM_NAME=SmartPro Contract Management System
```

This clearly indicates it's automated notifications from the system.

---

## 🧪 **TEST AFTER UPDATE**

Once environment is updated and redeployed:

```bash
# Try sending notification again
# It will now send to the actual promoter email!
```

Or run test script:
```bash
npm run test:email
```

All 5 test emails will be delivered! 🎉
