# Contract Status Workflow Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide documents the complete contract status workflow implementation with proper pending → approved → active → expired states.

## 🔄 Contract Workflow States

### Status Transitions

```
draft → pending → approved → active → expired/completed/terminated
                      ↓
                  rejected
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Color | Who Can Set | Next States |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `draft` | Initial creation, being edited | Gray | System, User | pending |
| `pending` | Awaiting admin approval | Orange | System (on submit) | approved, rejected, draft |
| `approved` | Approved by admin, ready to start | Blue | Admin only | active |
| `active` | Currently active (on/after start_date) | Green | System (automatic) | expired, completed, terminated |
| `completed` | Successfully finished | Emerald | Admin | - |
| `terminated` | Terminated before completion | Red | Admin | - |
| `expired` | Past end_date | Red | System (automatic) | - |
| `rejected` | Rejected during approval | Red | Admin | draft (if resubmitted) |

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20250125_complete_contract_workflow.sql`

**New Columns:**
- `approved_by` - UUID reference to admin who approved
- `approved_at` - Timestamp of approval
- `rejected_by` - UUID reference to admin who rejected
- `rejected_at` - Timestamp of rejection
- `rejection_reason` - Text explanation for rejection
- `changes_requested_by` - UUID reference to admin who requested changes
- `changes_requested_at` - Timestamp of change request
- `changes_requested_reason` - Text explanation of needed changes
- `submitted_for_review_at` - Timestamp when submitted for review

**Status Constraint:**
```sql
CHECK (status IN (
  'draft', 'pending', 'approved', 'active', 
  'completed', 'terminated', 'expired', 'rejected'
))
```

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Contract Creation
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/contracts`

**Changes:**
- All new contracts now start with `status: 'pending'`
- `submitted_for_review_at` is automatically set to current timestamp
- All contract creation variants updated to use pending status

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  contract_number: "CON-2025-001",
  status: "pending",
  submitted_for_review_at: "2025-01-25T10:00:00Z",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Contract Approval
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/contracts/[id]/approve`

**Required Permission:** `contract:approve:all` (Admin only)

**Actions:**
1. **approve** - Approve contract (pending → approved)
   ```json
   {
     "action": "approve"
   }
   ```

2. **reject** - Reject contract (pending → rejected)
   ```json
   {
     "action": "reject",
     "reason": "Missing required documentation"
   }
   ```

3. **request_changes** - Request changes (pending → draft)
   ```json
   {
     "action": "request_changes",
     "reason": "Please update salary to match job grade"
   }
   ```

4. **send_to_legal** - Flag for legal review
   ```json
   {
     "action": "send_to_legal"
   }
   ```

5. **send_to_hr** - Flag for HR review
   ```json
   {
     "action": "send_to_hr"
   }
   ```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Contract CON-2025-001 has been approved successfully",
  "contract": { /* updated contract */ },
  "action": "approve"
}
```

#### Contract Status Check
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/contracts/[id]/approve`

**Permission:** `contract:read:own`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "contract": {
    "id": "...",
    "status": "approved",
    "approved_by": "user-uuid",
    "approved_at": "2025-01-25T11:00:00Z",
    "submitted_for_review_at": "2025-01-25T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Components

#### ContractStatusBadge
**File:** `components/contracts/contract-status-badge.tsx`

**Usage:**
```tsx
<ContractStatusBadge 
  status="pending" 
  size="sm" 
  showIcon={true}
/>
```

**Supported Statuses:**
- draft (Gray)
- pending (Orange)
- approved (Blue)
- active (Green)
- completed (Emerald)
- terminated (Red)
- expired (Red)
- rejected (Red)

#### Pending Contracts Page
**File:** `app/[locale]/contracts/pending/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Fetches contracts with `status=pending`
- Shows submission timestamp
- Displays action menu with approve/reject options
- Bulk approval/rejection support
- Request changes functionality
- Send to legal/HR review

**Permissions Required:**
- View: `contract:read:own` or admin
- Actions: `contract:approve:all` (admin only)

#### Approved Contracts Page
**File:** `app/[locale]/contracts/approved/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Fetches contracts with `status=approved`
- Shows approval timestamp and approver
- Displays days until start date
- Download PDF functionality

#### All Contracts Page
**File:** `app/[locale]/contracts/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Shows all contracts with proper status badges
- Filter by status dropdown
- Status-based statistics cards
- Proper color coding for each status

### 4. Automatic Status Transitions

**Function:** `update_contract_status_based_on_dates()`

This function automatically updates contract statuses based on dates:

1. **approved → active**: When `start_date <= CURRENT_DATE`
2. **active → expired**: When `end_date < CURRENT_DATE`

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT update_contract_status_based_on_dates();
```

**Recommended Schedule:** Run daily via cron job

### 5. Database Views

#### Pending Contracts View
```sql
CREATE VIEW pending_contracts_view AS
SELECT 
  c.*,
  u.email as created_by_email,
  u.full_name as created_by_name,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (NOW() - c.submitted_for_review_at)) as days_pending
FROM contracts c
LEFT JOIN users u ON c.created_by = u.id
WHERE c.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY c.submitted_for_review_at ASC;
```

#### Approved Contracts View
```sql
CREATE VIEW approved_contracts_view AS
SELECT 
  c.*,
  u.email as approved_by_email,
  u.full_name as approved_by_name,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (c.start_date - CURRENT_DATE)) as days_until_start
FROM contracts c
LEFT JOIN users u ON c.approved_by = u.id
WHERE c.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY c.start_date ASC;
```

## 📈 Statistics & Metrics

### Dashboard Stats

The All Contracts page shows comprehensive statistics:

- **Total Contracts** - All contracts in database
- **Active** - Currently active contracts (green)
- **Pending** - Awaiting approval (orange)
- **Approved** - Approved but not yet active (blue)
- **Expiring Soon** - Active contracts ending within 30 days (amber)
- **Expired** - Past end date (red)

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Database Indexes

Created for performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_contracts_status ON contracts(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_contracts_approved_by ON contracts(approved_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_contracts_approved_at ON contracts(approved_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_contracts_pending_review ON contracts(status) WHERE status = 'pending';
CREATE INDEX idx_contracts_approved ON contracts(status) WHERE status = 'approved';
```

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

1. **Daily:** Run `update_contract_status_based_on_dates()` to update statuses
2. **Weekly:** Review pending contracts older than 7 days
3. **Monthly:** Archive completed/expired contracts

## 📝 Migration Notes

### Existing Contracts

The migration automatically updates existing contracts:

1. Contracts with `status = 'active'` but no `approved_by` → set to `pending`
2. Contracts with invalid status values → set to `pending`
3. Only affects contracts created in the last 60 days (safety measure)

### Rollback

If needed, you can rollback by:
```sql
ALTER TABLE contracts DROP CONSTRAINT contracts_status_check;
ALTER TABLE contracts ADD CONSTRAINT contracts_status_check 
  CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'active', 'completed', 'terminated', 'expired'));
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - Notify users when contract is approved/rejected
   - Notify admins when new contracts are submitted
   - Reminder emails for pending approvals

2. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Auto-approve contracts meeting certain criteria
   - Multi-level approval workflow
   - Conditional routing (legal → HR → final approval)

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - Track all status changes
   - Record who made each change and when
   - Provide detailed contract history

4. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by approver
   - Filter by submission date
