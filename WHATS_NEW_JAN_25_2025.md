                                                    ↓
                                               Rejected ❌
```

### For Users
**When you create a contract:**
1. Contract starts with **"Pending"** status (orange badge)
2. You'll see it on the **Pending Contracts** page
3. Wait for admin approval
4. Once approved, it appears on **Approved Contracts** page
5. Contract auto-activates on the start date

**If your contract is rejected:**

- You can edit and resubmit

### For Admins
