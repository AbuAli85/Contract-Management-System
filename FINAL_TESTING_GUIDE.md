## 2Ô∏è‚É£ PROMOTERS METRICS ‚úÖ

### What Was Implemented

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `components/promoters/enhanced-promoters-view-refactored.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `components/promoters/promoters-metrics-cards.tsx`

**Fixes:**
- All metrics now calculated client-side
- Added safety checks for undefined/null/NaN
- Proper number conversion for all values

### Testing Steps

#### Step 1: Navigate to Promoters Hub
```bash
Action: Navigate to /en/promoters

Expected:
‚úÖ Page loads successfully
‚úÖ All 4 metric cards visible
‚úÖ No console errors
‚úÖ No infinite loading states
```

#### Step 2: Verify Total Promoters Card
```bash
Metric Card: "Total promoters"
Main Value: Should show number (e.g., "25")
Helper Text: Should show "X active right now"
Icon: Users icon (group of people)
Color: Blue gradient

Expected:
‚úÖ Shows actual number, not "undefined"
‚úÖ Active count is accurate
‚úÖ Trend shows "new this week" if applicable
‚úÖ Clicking filters to show all promoters
```

#### Step 3: Verify Active Workforce Card
```bash
Metric Card: "Active workforce"
Main Value: Should show number of active promoters
Helper Text: Should show "X awaiting assignment"
Icon: UserCheck icon
Color: Neutral/gray

Expected:
‚úÖ Shows actual number, not "undefined"
‚úÖ "X awaiting assignment" shows actual number, not "undefined"
‚úÖ Number makes sense (0 or positive integer)
‚úÖ Clicking filters to show active promoters
```

#### Step 4: Verify Document Alerts Card
```bash
Metric Card: "Document alerts"
Main Value: Should show number of critical documents
Helper Text: Should show "X expiring soon"
Icon: ShieldAlert icon
Color: Red (if critical > 0) or Yellow (if critical = 0)

Expected:
‚úÖ Shows actual number, not "undefined"
‚úÖ "X expiring soon" shows actual number, not "undefined"
‚úÖ Color changes based on critical count
‚úÖ Clicking filters to show document alerts
```

#### Step 5: Verify Compliance Rate Card
```bash
Metric Card: "Compliance rate"
Main Value: Should show "X%" (percentage)
Helper Text: Should show "X assigned staff"
Icon: CheckCircle icon
Color: Green (if ‚â•90%) or Yellow (if <90%)

Expected:
‚úÖ Shows percentage like "85%", not "undefined%" or "NaN%"
‚úÖ "X assigned staff" shows actual number, not "NaN assigned staff"
‚úÖ Percentage is between 0-100
‚úÖ Assigned staff count makes sense
‚úÖ Clicking filters to show compliant promoters
```

#### Step 6: Test Edge Cases

**Test with No Promoters:**
```bash
Expected:
‚úÖ All metrics show 0
‚úÖ No errors or "undefined" values
‚úÖ Page renders correctly
```

**Test with Promoters but No Documents:**
```bash
Expected:
‚úÖ Critical: 0
‚úÖ Expiring: 0
‚úÖ Compliance Rate: 0%
‚úÖ All values display correctly
```

**Test with All Valid Documents:**
```bash
Expected:
‚úÖ Critical: 0
‚úÖ Compliance Rate: 100%
‚úÖ Green badge on compliance card
```

### Metrics Calculation Reference

| Metric | Calculation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Total | `pagination.total` or `dashboardPromoters.length` | 25 |
| Active | Promoters with `overallStatus === 'active'` | 18 |
| Critical | Promoters with expired ID or passport | 3 |
| Expiring | Promoters with expiring ID or passport | 5 |
| Unassigned | Promoters with `assignmentStatus === 'unassigned'` | 7 |
| Companies | Unique `employer_id` values | 4 |
| Recently Added | Created within last 7 days | 2 |

## üîç DATABASE VERIFICATION QUERIES

### Check Contract Status Distribution

```sql
-- Count contracts by status
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM contracts
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Expected output:
-- status    | count | percentage
-- pending   | 15    | 35.71
-- approved  | 10    | 23.81
-- active    | 12    | 28.57
-- expired   | 5     | 11.90
```

### Check Approval Tracking

```sql
-- Verify approval data integrity
SELECT 
  contract_number,
  status,
  submitted_for_review_at,
  approved_by,
  approved_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approved_at - submitted_for_review_at))/3600 as approval_hours
FROM contracts
WHERE status IN ('approved', 'active')
  AND approved_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY approved_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- All approved/active contracts should have:
-- ‚úÖ approved_by NOT NULL
-- ‚úÖ approved_at NOT NULL
-- ‚úÖ approval_hours > 0
```

### Check Promoter Metrics

```sql
-- Verify promoter counts match dashboard
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN id_card_expiry_date < NOW() OR passport_expiry_date < NOW() THEN 1 END) as critical,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN 
    (id_card_expiry_date BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days') OR
    (passport_expiry_date BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days')
  THEN 1 END) as expiring
FROM promoters;

-- Compare with dashboard metrics
-- All numbers should match exactly
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Contract stays in "pending" forever

**Cause:** Migration not applied  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if migration ran
psql -d your_database -c "SELECT * FROM contracts WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 1;"

# If columns missing, apply migration manually
psql -d your_database -f supabase/migrations/20250125_complete_contract_workflow.sql
```

### Issue: "undefined" still appears in metrics

**Cause:** Browser cache  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

# Or clear cache completely
```

### Issue: Approval button doesn't work

**Cause:** Permission error  
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check user has admin role
SELECT id, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Grant admin permission
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Issue: Pending page shows 403 error

**Cause:** Missing RBAC permission  
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check permissions exist
SELECT * FROM rbac_permissions WHERE name = 'contract:read:own';

-- Insert if missing
INSERT INTO rbac_permissions (resource, action, scope, name, description)
VALUES ('contract', 'read', 'own', 'contract:read:own', 'Read own contracts');
```
