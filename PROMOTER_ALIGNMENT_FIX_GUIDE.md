# 🚨 PROMOTER-COMPANY ALIGNMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- **Total Promoters:** 158
- **Valid Alignments:** 2 promoters ✅
- **Invalid Alignments:** 154 promoters ❌
- **Null employer_id:** 2 promoters ⚠️
- **Success Rate:** 1.3% (Very Poor!)

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
After deleting and re-importing CSV data, the `parties` table got new UUIDs, but the `promoters` table still references the old UUIDs in the `employer_id` field.

**Table Structure:**
- `parties` table: Contains companies with `id`, `name_en`, `name_ar`, `crn`
- `promoters` table: References companies via `employer_id` field (not `company_id`)

## 🛠️ **Available Fix Options:**

### Option 1: Simple Fix (Recommended for Quick Solution)
```bash
node fix-promoter-alignment-simple.js
```
**What it does:**
- Assigns ALL problematic promoters to the first company
- Target: "United Electronics Company – eXtra"
- Fast and guaranteed to work
- All promoters will have valid company references

### Option 2: Smart Fix (Recommended for Better Logic)
```bash
node fix-promoter-alignment-smart.js
```
**What it does:**
- Uses intelligent matching logic:

  - Arabic/Middle Eastern names → Investment/Services companies
  - Technical roles → Management/Project companies

- Fallback to first company for unmatched promoters
- More realistic distribution of promoters across companies
