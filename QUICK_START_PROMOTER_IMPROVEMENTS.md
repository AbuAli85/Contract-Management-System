```sql
-- Create bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('promoter-documents', 'promoter-documents', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Add policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage promoter documents"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'promoter-documents')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'promoter-documents');
```

## Step 3: Build & Test (2 minutes)

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works

Run these SQL queries in Supabase:

```sql
