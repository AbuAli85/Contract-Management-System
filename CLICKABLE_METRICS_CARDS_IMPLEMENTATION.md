# Clickable Metrics Cards Implementation

## ✅ Feature Complete

The metric cards on the Promoters Intelligence Hub are now fully interactive and clickable to filter the promoters list below.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Clickable Metric Cards**

Each of the four metric cards is now clickable:

#### Card 1: Total Promoters 👥
- **Click action**: Show all promoters
- **Filter applied**: Clear all filters
- **Visual**: Primary blue styling with trend indicator

#### Card 2: Active Workforce 💼
- **Click action**: Show assigned active promoters
- **Filter applied**: 
  - Status: `active`
  - Assignment: `assigned`
- **Visual**: Neutral gray styling

#### Card 3: Document Alerts ⚠️
- **Click action**: Show promoters with document issues
- **Filter applied**:
  - Documents: `expired`
- **Visual**: Red (danger) or amber (warning) styling based on critical count

#### Card 4: Compliance Rate ✅
- **Click action**: Show compliant assigned promoters
- **Filter applied**:
  - Status: `active`
  - Assignment: `assigned`
- **Visual**: Green (success) or amber (warning) based on compliance rate

### 2. **Interactive Features**

#### Click Behavior:
- **First click**: Applies the filter
- **Second click** (same card): Clears all filters (toggle behavior)
- **Click different card**: Switches to that filter

#### Visual Feedback:
- ✅ **Hover effects**: 
  - Shadow increases (`hover:shadow-xl`)
  - Card lifts up (`hover:-translate-y-1`)
  - Scales slightly (`hover:scale-[1.03]`)
- ✅ **Active state**:
  - Primary ring indicator (`ring-2 ring-primary`)
  - Pulsing dot in top-right corner
  - Elevated shadow
- ✅ **Click animation**: Scales down briefly (`active:scale-[0.98]`)
- ✅ **Cursor**: Changes to pointer on hover

#### Accessibility:
- ✅ **Keyboard navigation**: Tab to focus cards
- ✅ **Keyboard activation**: Press Enter or Space to click
- ✅ **ARIA labels**: Descriptive labels for screen readers
- ✅ **ARIA pressed**: Indicates active state
- ✅ **Role**: Cards have `role="button"`
- ✅ **Tab index**: Focusable with keyboard

### 3. **Smart Filter Logic**

```typescript
handleMetricCardClick(filterType) {
  // Toggle behavior: Click same card again to clear filters
  if (activeMetricFilter === filterType) {
    clearAllFilters();
    return;
  }

  // Apply card-specific filters
  switch (filterType) {
    case 'all': 
      // Clear all filters
      break;
    case 'active':
      // Status: active, Assignment: assigned
      break;
    case 'alerts':
      // Documents: expired
      break;
    case 'compliance':
      // Status: active, Assignment: assigned
      break;
  }

  // Scroll to filtered list
  scrollToTable();

  // Show confirmation toast
  showToast();
}
```

### 4. **Auto-Scroll Feature**

When you click a metric card:
1. Filter is applied instantly
2. Page smoothly scrolls to the promoters list (100ms delay)
3. Toast notification confirms the filter

### 5. **Visual Indicators**

#### Active Card Shows:
- 🔵 **Primary ring** around the card
- 🟣 **Pulsing blue dot** in top-right corner
- 📐 **Elevated shadow** (more prominent)
- 📊 **ARIA pressed state** for accessibility

#### Hover State Shows:
- 🔼 **Card lifts up** (-1px translateY)
- 🔍 **Shadow intensifies**
- 📏 **Slight scale increase** (1.03x)
- 👆 **Pointer cursor**

## 🎨 Visual Examples

```

## 📊 Filter Mappings

## 📊 Filter Logic Details

### Total Promoters Card:
```javascript
// Clears all filters
setStatusFilter('all');
setDocumentFilter('all');
setAssignmentFilter('all');
// Shows: All 112 promoters
```

### Active Workforce Card:
```javascript
// Shows assigned active promoters
setStatusFilter('active');
setAssignmentFilter('assigned');
// Shows: Promoters that are:
//   - Status = active
//   - Have employer assigned
```

### Document Alerts Card:
```javascript
// Shows promoters with document issues
setDocumentFilter('expired');
// Shows: Promoters with:
//   - ID expired OR
//   - Passport expired
```

```javascript
// Shows compliant assigned promoters
setStatusFilter('active');
setAssignmentFilter('assigned');
// Shows: Promoters that are:
//   - Status = active
//   - Have employer assigned
//   - (Implies valid documents based on context)
```

## 🔄 State Management

### State Added:
```typescript
const [activeMetricFilter, setActiveMetricFilter] = useState<
  'all' | 'active' | 'alerts' | 'compliance' | null
>(null);
```

### State Flow:
```
Card Click
    ↓
handleMetricCardClick(filterType)
    ↓
setActiveMetricFilter(filterType)
    ↓
Props passed to PromotersMetricsCards
    ↓
