# 📊 Complete Export/Import Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide explains how to export promoter data from your application and import it back into Supabase, including handling company relationships and data updates.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- `csv-parser` package installed: `npm install csv-parser`
- Access to your Supabase project

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Export Data from Application

1. **Navigate to Promoter Management**
   - Go to `/manage-promoters` in your application
   - Apply any filters you want (search, status, company, etc.)

2. **Export to CSV**
   - Click the **"Export CSV"** button
   - File will download as `promoters-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

- ✅ Creates missing companies automatically
- ✅ Links promoters to companies
- ✅ Updates existing records (by ID card number)
- ✅ Handles relationships and foreign keys
- ✅ Shows detailed progress and results

### Step 3: Verify Import

1. **Check Promoter Management Page**
   - Navigate to `/manage-promoters`
   - Verify all promoters are displayed
   - Check that company relationships are correct

2. **Check Companies Page**
   - Navigate to `/manage-parties`
   - Verify new companies were created (if any)
   - Check company details

3. **Verify Data Integrity**
   - Check that all fields imported correctly
   - Verify document status calculations
   - Test search and filter functionality

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: name_en, name_ar, id_card_number
- **Duplicate Detection**: Based on ID card number
- **Company Linking**: Automatic based on company name matching

### Error Handling
- **Missing Companies**: Automatically created as "Employer" type
- **Duplicate Promoters**: Updated instead of creating duplicates
- **Invalid Data**: Skipped with error reporting
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanism for failed imports

### Performance
- **Large Datasets**: Processed one record at a time for error handling
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time feedback on import progress
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient streaming for large CSV files

## 🔄 Use Cases

### 1. Data Backup
```bash
# Export current data
# (Use Export CSV button in UI)

# Import to backup database
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 2. Data Migration
```bash
# Export from old system
# Import to new Supabase project
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 3. Data Update
```bash
# Export current data
# Edit in Excel/Google Sheets
# Import updated data (updates existing records)
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 4. Bulk Data Import
```bash
# Prepare CSV with new promoters
# Import with company relationships
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"CSV file not found"**
   - Make sure you exported the CSV first
   - Check file is in the project root directory
   - Verify filename is `promoters-export.csv`

2. **"Environment variables not found"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Restart your terminal after updating `.env`

3. **"csv-parser not installed"**
   ```bash
   npm install csv-parser
   ```

4. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Check Supabase RLS policies
   - Verify your API key has write permissions
   - Check table structure matches expected schema

5. **"Duplicate key" errors**
   - The script handles this automatically
   - Existing records are updated, not duplicated
   - Check ID card numbers for uniqueness

### Debug Mode
Add this to see detailed error information:
```javascript
// Add to script for debugging
console.log('Debug data:', promoter);
```

## 📈 Best Practices

1. **Always backup before import**
2. **Test with small datasets first**
3. **Verify data integrity after import**
4. **Use the advanced script for production**
5. **Keep CSV files for audit trails**
6. **Document any custom field mappings**
