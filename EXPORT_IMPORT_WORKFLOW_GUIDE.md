## üö® Important Notes

### Data Validation

- **Required Fields**: name_en, name_ar, id_card_number
- **Duplicate Detection**: Based on ID card number
- **Company Linking**: Automatic based on company name matching

### Error Handling

- **Missing Companies**: Automatically created as "Employer" type
- **Duplicate Promoters**: Updated instead of creating duplicates
- **Invalid Data**: Skipped with error reporting
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanism for failed imports

### Performance

- **Large Datasets**: Processed one record at a time for error handling
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time feedback on import progress
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient streaming for large CSV files

## üîÑ Use Cases

### 1. Data Backup

```bash
# Export current data
# (Use Export CSV button in UI)

# Import to backup database
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 2. Data Migration

```bash
# Export from old system
# Import to new Supabase project
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 3. Data Update

```bash
# Export current data
# Edit in Excel/Google Sheets
# Import updated data (updates existing records)
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

### 4. Bulk Data Import

```bash
# Prepare CSV with new promoters
# Import with company relationships
node import-promoters-with-companies.js
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"CSV file not found"**
   - Make sure you exported the CSV first
   - Check file is in the project root directory
   - Verify filename is `promoters-export.csv`

2. **"Environment variables not found"**
   - Check your `.env` file exists
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Restart your terminal after updating `.env`

3. **"csv-parser not installed"**

   ```bash
   npm install csv-parser
   ```

4. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Check Supabase RLS policies
   - Verify your API key has write permissions
   - Check table structure matches expected schema

5. **"Duplicate key" errors**
   - The script handles this automatically
   - Existing records are updated, not duplicated
   - Check ID card numbers for uniqueness

### Debug Mode

Add this to see detailed error information:

```javascript
// Add to script for debugging
console.log('Debug data:', promoter);
```

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Always backup before import**
2. **Test with small datasets first**
3. **Verify data integrity after import**
4. **Use the advanced script for production**
5. **Keep CSV files for audit trails**
6. **Document any custom field mappings**

## üéâ Success Checklist

After running the import, verify:

- [ ] All promoters appear in the management page
- [ ] Company relationships are correct
- [ ] Search and filters work properly
- [ ] Document status calculations are accurate
- [ ] No duplicate records exist
- [ ] All required fields are populated
- [ ] Date formats are correct
- [ ] Status badges display properly
