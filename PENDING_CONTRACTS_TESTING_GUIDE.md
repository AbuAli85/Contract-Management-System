## API Response Validation

### Test API Directly

```bash
# Test the API endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/contracts?status=pending" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "contracts": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "contract_number": "CON-12345",
      "status": "pending",
      "job_title": "Software Engineer",
      "first_party": { "name_en": "ABC Corp" },
      "second_party": { "name_en": "XYZ Ltd" },
      "promoters": { "name_en": "John Doe" },
      ...
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "pending": 3,
    "total": 10,
    ...
  },
  "pendingContracts": 3
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Infinite Loading
**Symptoms:** Page stuck on loading spinner forever

**Checks:**
- [ ] Check console for permission timeout warning
- [ ] Check Network tab for failed/pending requests
- [ ] Verify user has `contract:read:own` permission

**Expected Fix:**
- Should timeout after 10 seconds
- Should show error or permission message

---

### Issue 2: Shows Error for 0 Results
**Symptoms:** Error message when there are no pending contracts

**Checks:**
- [ ] Check console log: should say "ℹ️ No pending contracts found - this is normal"
- [ ] API should return `{ success: true, contracts: [] }`
- [ ] UI should show green success state, not red error

**Expected Behavior:**
- Green clock icon
- Success message
- No error styling

---

### Issue 3: Multiple API Calls
**Symptoms:** Network tab shows duplicate requests

**Checks:**
- [ ] Check console for "⏸️ Fetch already in progress"
- [ ] Verify `fetchAttemptedRef` is working

**Expected Behavior:**
- Only one request at a time
- Subsequent clicks should be ignored until first completes

---

### Issue 4: Memory Leak Warnings
**Symptoms:** Console warnings about updating unmounted components

**Checks:**
- [ ] Navigate away during loading
- [ ] Check for proper cleanup in useEffect
- [ ] Verify `mountedRef` checks

**Expected Behavior:**
- No warnings in console
- Clean navigation

---

## Automated Testing (Optional)

### Jest Test Example
```typescript
describe('Pending Contracts Page', () => {
  it('should show loading state initially', () => {
    render(<PendingContractsPage />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/loading pending contracts/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('should show success state with 0 contracts', async () => {
    mockAPI({ contracts: [], success: true });
    render(<PendingContractsPage />);
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText(/no pending contracts/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText(/all contracts are up to date/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
  
  it('should handle timeout error', async () => {
    mockAPI({ delay: 11000 }); // Delay longer than timeout
    render(<PendingContractsPage />);
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText(/request timeout/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    }, { timeout: 12000 });
  });
});
```
