# Terminology Clarification Implementation

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** "Available" vs "Awaiting Assignment" confusion  
**Solution:** Option 3 - Show both metrics with clear explanations

---

## 🎯 **The Problem**

Two similar-sounding metrics with different meanings:

| Metric | Value | Definition |
|:-------|:------|:-----------|
| **Available for Work** | 78 | Promoters with `status = 'available'` |
| **Awaiting Assignment** | 174 | All promoters without active contracts (active + available) |

**User Confusion:** Why are these numbers different?

---

## ✅ **The Solution: Side-by-Side Comparison**

### **Implementation: Clarity Card**

Added a new card above the workforce overview that shows both metrics side-by-side with:

1. **Visual Distinction**
   - "Available for Work" → Blue theme
   - "Awaiting Assignment" → Purple theme
   - Different icons for each

2. **Clear Definitions**
   - Subtext under each number
   - Tooltips with detailed explanations
   - Key difference summary

3. **Calculation Transparency**
   ```
   Available for Work: 78
   (Status = 'available')
   
   Awaiting Assignment: 174
   (Active: 96 + Available: 78 = 174)
   ```

## 🔍 **Detailed Breakdown**

### **Available for Work (78)**

**Definition:**
- Promoters with `status = 'available'` in database
- Actively seeking new assignments
- Ready for immediate placement

**Business Logic:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM promoters 
WHERE status_enum = 'available';
-- Returns: 78
```

**Use Case:** 
"How many promoters can I assign to a new contract **right now**?"

---

### **Awaiting Assignment (174)**

**Definition:**
- All promoters who could work but aren't on contracts
- Includes both "available" and "active" (employed) statuses
- Excludes: on leave, inactive, terminated

**Business Logic:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM promoters 
WHERE status_enum IN ('active', 'available')
  AND id NOT IN (
    SELECT promoter_id 
    FROM contracts 
    WHERE status = 'active' 
      AND promoter_id IS NOT NULL
  );
-- Returns: 174 (96 active + 78 available)
```

**Calculation:**
```
Total Workforce:           181
Less:
  - On Leave:                0
  - Inactive:                3
  - Terminated:              4
  - On Active Contracts:     0
────────────────────────────
Awaiting Assignment:       174
```

**Use Case:**
"How many promoters are **employable and not currently assigned**?"

---

## 💡 **Why Both Metrics Matter**

### **Scenario 1: Urgent Assignment**

**Question:** "I need someone for a contract starting tomorrow."

**Answer:** Check **Available for Work (78)**
- These promoters are ready and actively seeking work
- No employment conflicts
- Can start immediately

---

### **Scenario 2: Capacity Planning**

**Question:** "How many promoters could I potentially assign to contracts?"

**Answer:** Check **Awaiting Assignment (174)**
- Includes available (78) + active but unassigned (96)
- Shows full capacity
- Useful for long-term planning

---

### **Scenario 3: Understanding the Gap**

**Gap:** 174 - 78 = 96 promoters

**Explanation:** These 96 promoters have "active" status but aren't on contracts
- They're employed (on payroll)
- Between assignments
- Could take new work if needed

---

## 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**

### **1. Visual Hierarchy**

```tsx
// Clear visual separation
<div className='grid grid-cols-2 gap-4'>
  <div className='border-2 border-blue-200'> {/* Available */}
  <div className='border-2 border-purple-200'> {/* Awaiting */}
</div>
```

### **2. Tooltips**

**Available for Work:**
```
Promoters specifically marked as "available" status - 
ready and actively seeking new assignments right now.
```

**Awaiting Assignment:**
```
Total promoters not currently on contracts - includes 
those with "active" status (employed) + "available" 
status. Excludes on leave, inactive, and terminated.
```

### **3. Summary Box**

```tsx
<div className='bg-blue-100 rounded-lg'>
  Key Difference: "Available" shows promoters actively 
  seeking work, "Awaiting Assignment" includes employed 
  promoters who could take new work.
</div>
```
