# 🎯 Final Cleanup Steps - Action Plan

## ✅ Status: Review Complete

The review found: **🔴 You have test/mock contracts - SAFE TO DELETE**

---

## 📋 3-Step Cleanup Process

### Step 1: See What Will Be Deleted

Run this query to preview:

**File**: `DELETE-MOCK-CONTRACTS-FINAL.sql` (STEP 1 section only)

This shows:
- ✅ Exact list of contracts to be deleted
- ✅ Reason for deletion (test keyword, mock keyword, etc.)
- ✅ Total count
- ✅ Created dates

**ExpectedMenuContracts with "test", "mock", "sample" in title/number

---

### Step 2: Execute Deletion

After reviewing the list from Step 1:

1. Open `DELETE-MOCK-CONTRACTS-FINAL.sql`
2. Find **STEP 2** section
3. **Uncomment** the entire section (remove `/*` and `*/`)
4. **Run the script**

This will:
- Drop triggers temporarily
- Delete test/mock contracts
- Recreate triggers
- Show confirmation

---

### Step 3: Verify Cleanup

The script automatically shows:
- ✅ Total contracts remaining
- ✅ Contracts by status
- ✅ Top 5 parties with counts
- ✅ Confirmation that mock data is gone

**Expected Results**:
```
Total Contracts: ~424 (or slightly less if mock data removed)
Top 5 Parties: Same as before (205, 116, 75, 16, 12)
Test/Mock Contracts: 0 ✅
```

---

## 🔍 What the Script Does

### STEP 1: Preview (Always Runs)
```sql
-- Shows contracts to be deleted
SELECT contract_number, title, status, created_at
FROM contracts
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%test%' OR LOWER(title) LIKE '%mock%' ...
```

### STEP 2: Delete (Commented - You uncomment)
```sql
/* UNCOMMENT THIS SECTION

-- Temporarily drop triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_contract_party_ids_trigger ON contracts CASCADE;

-- Delete mock contracts
DELETE FROM contracts
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%test%' OR LOWER(title) LIKE '%mock%' ...;

-- Recreate triggers
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_contract_party_ids() ...

*/
```

### STEP 3: Verify (Always Runs)
```sql
-- Shows current state after deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contracts;
-- Shows top parties still have correct counts
```

---

## ⚠️ Safety Features

The script includes multiple safety checks:

1. ✅ **Preview first** - Shows exactly what will be deleted
2. ✅ **Commented DELETE** - Must manually uncomment
3. ✅ **Trigger recreation** - Automatically recreates after deletion
4. ✅ **Verification** - Shows results immediately after
5. ✅ **Preserves real data** - Only targets test/mock keywords

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### Before Cleanup
```
Total: 219 contracts (example)
├─ Real contracts: ~215
└─ Test/mock: ~4
```
