  - Expandable rows showing assigned promoters
  - Document expiry tracking (CR, License)
  - Contract count per employer
  - Advanced filtering and search

#### 3. **Clients** (`/[locale]/manage-parties/clients`)
- **Purpose**: View all client-type parties
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive list of all clients
  - Contact information display
  - Document expiry tracking
  - Contract count per client
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - Statistics dashboard
